Ghostranch

It was too cold to sit by the pool, even sheltered from the wind, so I decided to drive up into the snow.

It had been ten years, but I figured it wouldn't have melted yet.

There is a familiarity that is quite compelling.  The pink adobe by the intersection was too obvious a memory.   But at 60 mph looking down to a little farm yard of log buildings topped by bright red metal roofs,  that worked.

I was probably never the driver. And we would always have had at least one dog along.

I don't know how many times we would have done this.  Fewer than I think, probably. At least once it was this same loop, down through the valley of abstract roads.

I was an adult then too, already a full grown bladder.  As  I sit here typing this, overlooking a valley with one of those emerald lakes in the distance, I know that when I finish and get out of the car, step over the guard rail, I'll find a gently sloping hill, easy enough to walk down a few feet so that I can pee out of sight of the passing traffic.

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>You’ll have to forgive me. I’m in a bad
mood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>As I was leaving my apartment this
morning I tossed a lit match onto a pile of dirty clothes. It just seemed like
nothing less than the sound of sirens would make me feel like I was awake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>That’s not strictly true. I did wake up
in a bad mood. But as I was leaving my apartment I thought of that line. And
then I felt better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>It can be so magic when you think of the
right words at the right time. At least for me. And I guess it's just because
it doesn't happen that often. But, about ten years ago, I was just hanging
around Yonge and Dundas in Toronto, early evening, and Malcolm McLaren came by
in one of those rickshaw things. He and the driver were sprawled up on the
bench, a pack of six uniformed school girls were pulling the rickshaw.  I just
dropped my few bags of groceries and dashed over, ran alongside, and asked
&quot;Mr. McLaren, would you mind if I asked you a question?&quot; &quot;Well, (pause),
sure.&quot; &quot;What's the best way to make a good first impression?&quot;
And he said &quot;Good question.&quot;, slouched even farther back and offered
me a split of champagne from a cooler beside him. I declined, already feeling a
little nauseated from the continued running. He thought for ten or fifteen
seconds before replying &quot;Well, first, a general piece of advice, never
worry about fidelity. And second, for a good first impression, my best advice
is always have your entrance accompanied by the sound of breaking glass.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>On a recent business trip to retrieve
antique medical supplies from the beaches on the gulf coast of Texas I returned
to my hotel in Corpus Christi early one evening to discover about 400 people
huddled into a group, being herded by two college-aged women. I rushed into the
gift shop to buy a disposable camera to capture this oddity but found they were
out of cameras, out of film. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The gardener manning the cash register in
the gift shop told me the whole thing had started about 10 that morning when
Ellen and Joanne (the two college students) had decided to get a picture of
themselves at the hotel before they went home. They had asked one of the hotel
maids to take the picture. Then they’d decided they should get a picture of
themselves with the maid due to her involvement in their trip (through the
taking of the previous snapshot). They’d asked a passing guest to take a
picture of them with the maid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Of course it had then seemed equally
appropriate to get a picture with their new friend (the guest). So they had
called up a bell hop to take a picture of themselves with the maid and the
guest. And this process had continued until my return.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Ellen had bought out the gift shop of all
its film and she and Joanne were now busy keeping the crowd together until the
emergency van from Kodak arrived with more. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Never one to shy away from ultimate
responsibility I commandeered the laser printer at the front desk and ran off
some business cards labeling myself as a licensed therapist. I was able to
convince Ellen and Joanne that their entire vacation experience was actually
accurately portrayed already by the 1968 movie length episode of the Brady
Bunch (“The Brady Bunch Go to Hawaii”, available at most Blockbuster Video
stores). In fact both Ellen and Joanne had spent more hours watching Cindy
Brady on tv than they had looking at themselves in the mirror. Cindy was a more
accurate representation of their inner self-image. So they let the people go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The hotel comp’d my room and my bar tab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>This was when I learned the power of
television.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And then there was a fast road trip I
took with my brother once. We were heading up to British Columbia to visit the
world’s largest naturally occurring hydro-electric generator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>John Fante lent us his car for the trip.
It had a radar detector, a rear-view mirror, everything. He had been the best
rally car driver in the world, before he went blind. Now he was ranked number
three</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>We began picking up speed as we came down
from the Sierra Mountains. We were at 80 when we hit Reno. We slingshotted
around the money and sex and were up to 100 by the time we left the county.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The moon was full, and our lights didn't
give us enough distance anyway, so we shut them off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>About 40 miles down the road Jack Kerouac
screamed past us in his sister-in-law's 1940 Chevrolet. He was returning it to
her on the coast. The odometer cable left a trail of sparks as it bounced along
behind him. And he wasn't too far ahead when he turned off, into the Mustang
Ranch. He was picking up another car, or a new woman, it was too dark to tell
which.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Half an hour later (we smelled the ether
first) we pulled up along side Dr. Hunter S. Thompson hunched over the wheel.
The dome light was on. A burly Samoan beside him was fixing something. The
engine was whining in the stainless steel, 4-wheel drive Lambourghini. He had
his foot to the floor. We wouldn't have had a chance against him, except the
good doctor didn't realize he was only in third.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Around the corner and over the hill, was
William S. Burroughs, hat on head, cane in hand, thumb out and up. We almost
lost it as the right tires hit the gravel. We reversed right back to where he
was. He looked inside our car, and politely declined the ride. He waved us on
our way, warning us &quot;Never trust a man with a wallet&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>We were back up to speed, and almost at
our destination when we saw the mail truck stopped, straddling the line. Again
we hit the ditch, aiming for some sage brush to slow us down. But what really
slowed us down was the guy we hit. He flew 40 feet ahead, and to the left. We
came to a stop beside him. His pants were undone, we recognized the dirty
shorts and the pock-marked face. It was Bukowski. He still had vital signs, he
would be fine, he'd had worse. We left our last two bottles of red wine beside
him, and headed off to the bright lights of Winemucca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>That was when I learned the power of
speed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Another tv story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I sued some people once. I don’t remember
what it was about actually but that’s not relevant. I got a medium up on the
stand. She could channel Alexander the Great. I decided to use him as a
character witness. It was at this point that the judge chose to disallow press
in the courtroom. I went out and had my left eyeball replaced with a Hi-8
camera (professional quality, full colour separation). The single point of view
shots actually made for better style. It gave it all a Woody Allen feel. And it
made me look sympathetic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Of course Alexander was only willing to
speak in his own mother tongue (a Turkish offshoot of ancient Greek). We
advertised all over for a translator. We found one woman out in Calgary that
spoke it but it was all that she spoke, so that was no good. In the end, I was
forced to do the translating myself. I mean, I did translate properly. I do
have integrity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So then, the next snag - Alexander had
never heard of me, was unwilling to provide a character reference, and merely
laughed at the threat of being held for contempt. I took that all the way to
the supreme court. I mean, I’d been forced (under the threat of legal
sanctions) to attend public school and learn about Alexander, yet he didn’t
know who I was. What sort of a basis is that for a democracy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The plea bargaining began. They offered a
position as starting center for the Montréal Canadiens. I accepted, but only on
the condition that I could play riding one of those ice bikes, one of the ones
with spikes instead of tires. They counter-offered: Queen for a day. But they
could only offer a day when I would have had to spend the day watching soldiers
march by a reviewing stand. So I just took them all out. A hollow point each
from my Walther PPK (carved out of whale bone to get through security).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Biggest ratings ever. Within 45 minutes
there were 14 satellites with channels just rebroadcasting the killing
continuously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>At first I worried about the police.
There was an advantage that Alexander knew me now, and would probably give a
good reference after the mayhem, but still it would be hard to beat the rap on
a simulcast crime. Luckily everyone had forgotten it wasn’t fiction. The
immediate families complained but they were quickly locked up in the wards with
people who thought they were Thurston Howell III.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And I’d cleaned out the court room when I
left. I traded the stuff to Ted Turner for a 5% ownership in the new Fox kids
cartoon political panel show. The one where they let real politicians fight it
out using cartoon violence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>That was when I learned the power of  caring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And I like to think of myself as a bit of
an amateur scientist. Maybe I read a few too many Tom Swift books as a child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Heavy alpha radiation (plutonium’s
unpleasantness) is primarily a health risk because of the scattering of heavy
metals (impurities) throughout our bodies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately these carefully placed
impurities are essential to our continued good health. Intriguingly this is a
trait pecular to primates. It is only us monkeys who have been discouraged by
nature from playing with such toys. I was the one who discovered this. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I have been breeding mongrels for twenty
years (a mix of terrier and shepherd). I was playing around with purity of
diet, purity and refinement, of both food and water. And I must admit that it
was merely by accident that I forgot to include a source of heavy metals in
their intake. Veterinary science would have told me they would have died. But
they didn’t. I have 94 healthy dogs completely heavy metal free. They are
perfectly trained to eat and drink only from carefully maintained feeding
stations throughout the city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And I have implanted 1/16 of the critical
mass of plutonium into each of them.  A painless procedure for them, done under
local anesthesia. For me, the handling of such amounts is sure to cause death
within 5 to 10 years. Oh well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So. If 16 or more of these dogs get
together, BOOM. Which randomly is pretty unlikely. From a quantum mechanical
point of view it is as likely as the appearance of three foot mushrooms in
everyone’s bathroom next election day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Of course, if I blow my special flocking
whistle or am somehow unable to refill all the feeding stations these
probabilities increase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>[It may be best to consider this as
television, only faster.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>One unlucky gust and the swarm of
grasshoppers (so thick that even a mile away you can't help but close your
mouth, to keep the crunchy tobacco filled bastards out) begin an inward spiral
that will leave them days later at the center of bare dirt, with no food left
but themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>On any journey of a sizable length it is
vital to begin in the right direction.  So I want to figure out exactly where
to begin my story. It is made more difficult by the fact that I don’t really
have very much to say. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Really I just want to have fun. I’m a bit
of a goof but I do mean well. Maybe I’m even a bit of a romantic.  I mean a
couple of years ago I woke up happy one morning, a half pound lighter than
usual, and asked my best friend to marry me. She told me to fuck off, hung up
the phone, threw her cat from her chest, and was back to sleep within 17
seconds. When she awoke two and a half hours later she had no memory of the
phone call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So I went through my address book, not
entirely randomly, phoning other single women friends, until finally Brenda
said ok, she'd marry me if I really wanted. We arranged to meet at the food
court at 12:30. She agreed to wear white underwear once I conceded that the
request was an unfortunate reminder of my sexist traditional upbringing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>We met and shared a poutine with extra
cheese (a wedding day being once in a lifetime), talked about kids and
breakfast foods and the contrast between flannel and Egyptian cotton sheets and
where we would live and how often we would do laundry.  And we shared a medium
diet coke, one cup, two straws.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But when the plastic seats began to be
uncomfortable I had to admit that I didn't know where city hall was, and
although she did she said that it would probably be closed on a Saturday, and
even if it had been a weekday she thought that maybe being married at city hall
was an anachronism (or even an entirely untrue movie myth) and that their best
bet would be to find a judge, but she didn't know any.  I recalled I had known
a judge in Saskatoon, not that that helped, and anyway that judge had retired
and moved to Vancouver, and then I remembered that judge had married my brother
and sister-in-law, so Brenda was probably right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So instead we just wandered around the
mall, giggling a lot and making up our own connect the dots game, until the
stores closed and I walked her home. We almost kissed at her door and then I
skipped off into the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I wish I had a dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I wish I had a dream last night that I
was standing in a parking lot in Las Vegas, with the eight wonders of the world
surrounding me in neon. Everything antiseptic dirt and dry heat. And then I see
my niece Beth standing inside a wire fence, beside a pool at the Motel 6. And I
just walk over and go through a convenient gate in the fence. And she notices
me and runs over and gives me a hug. And Peter is there, before his prison
tattoos. And then I notice I'm wearing no pants, but we're at a pool anyway,
and they both know I'm a goof so I don't care. And we just hang around, eating
home-made popsicles and doing cannonballs. And hours later a big green UFO
zooms in with a sound of electric horror and sucks me up. And I awake to my
alarm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But, I never remember my dreams anymore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Some people become more self reflective
as they mature. I become more self referential.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Family Values</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And I guess its important to tell you
about my family. I’m not really sure how relevant they are, but I know a lot of
people fixate on family</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>My great great uncle, Uncle Carl (on my
mother's side) invented pornographic moving pictures. I mean, history's been
rewritten. He doesn't get the credit he deserves (not that my mother's upset
about that). His was one of those paradigm shifts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Before him, pornography had been just
about power, and exploitation. Carl invented the objectification of women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Everyone said that Carl had the most
amazing skin.  I imagine I can see some sort of glow in the few tinctographs we
have of him, but its hard to tell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Carl's mother loved him, truly she did,
but she was shy. When he was an infant she carried him with her always, and she
bathed him and tickled him and gave him a million little hugs every day.  But
when he grew up a little, became a little boy, loud and gregarious as boys
always are, she realized he was actually a separate person and her shyness
returned.  After the age of seven, the only physical contact she had with him
was holding his hand when they walked in town, and occasional kisses on the
cheek (one each birthday, christmas, and when departing or arriving from any
journey).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And Carl might have seemed gregarious to
his mother, but he had inherited her shyness. He never fought or wrestled, he
never joined the football team, he never went to the school dances. He was
embarrassed and confused at how alone he felt, and how much he craved some sort
of contact. And how easy it seemed for everyone else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Once, when he was twelve, and a new guy
moved into town, and before the new guy had 'learned about Carl', the new guy
played a practical joke (the old pail of water on top of the door) and got Carl
soaking wet.  And Carl loved it, it was so palsy,  almost like a hug.  But of
course, Carl didn't get mad like he should have, and that just left all his
classmates even more intimidated by him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But Carl grew up, and in the end he
wasn't particularly unhappy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So, from the age of seven, for the rest
of his life, Carl never touched another person, except for firm handshakes,
familial kisses, and not too tight hugs. He never cupped a person's face in his
hand. I mean, at least physically, at one level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But then you get into philosophy, and the
sex drive.  I mean, I have this one friend who has been forgiven for the most
insensitive, destructive acts by past lovers, because they all feel he has some
uncontrollably strong sex drive. He would die without a regular fuck. Its just
a scam they all play on themselves, because he's cute, and I'm sure he's great
in bed, but that he'd die. Come on now. I mean, who hasn't sometimes felt like
that, but you just masturbate, more than once if you have to, and it all
becomes manageable again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So Carl. Carl had a sex drive. That he
dealt with. And considering he couldn't even imagine kissing someone, let alone
sex, he saw no reason to be self conscious. He had nothing to gain or lose.  I
mean, he was shy, it was hard to talk to anybody, but it was no easier to tell
someone about what he had ordered for breakfast, than to tell them about his
late night virtual world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I have a portion of a letter he wrote to
his friend Wilfred Franklin:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;I can remember, as an adolescent,
when I would have dreams during my sleep, dreams of sex, and these dreams would
be so intensely physical. I would feel the woman's skin, and feel all of her
textures. I was amazed, I couldn't imagine where those sensations were coming
from. They were all so real, they had to be based on memories, but memories
beyond my recollection, memories beyond my life. As I have grown older these
physical dreams have stopped. Now my dreams are purely visual. I see the bodies
and the acts and they are beautiful and sensual in and of themselves.  I must
admit to you, my dear friend, that I have not been able to give up all hope of
ever being with a woman, in this lifetime, but I have certainly lost the
ability to even fantasize such an event. It seems easier to imagine that the
world will end tomorrow in one of those fiery cataclysms described by Wells. 
So, although it must have been a slow process, I have realized that now the
objects of my sexual desire are no longer women themselves, but merely the
images of women. I have had to bypass my skin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So it wasn't that Carl made the first
pornographic movie. He never made any. It was a letter he wrote to Wilfred
Franklin that made Franklin make the first movie.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Before this, pornography excited men
because it was proof that somewhere their sadly ideal world existed, where real
women would walk around naked, and smile, and do exactly what men wanted.  It
was an aid to imagining real physicality's, real touches.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But Franklin was a technical genius, just
beginning to understand this new media, of moving pictures, and how much easier
it made fooling the mind into an alternate reality. And he was intrigued by
Carl's new found mode of sex, and became determined to find it himself, through
his art.  And he did. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Carl never watched any of Franklin's
movies.  He was a bit too much of a prude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I've been told that I have my uncle's
skin. I don't know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But pardon me if I don't touch you, it's
not that I don't want to. It's all a bit confusing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>O.K. since I wrote that piece I've
decided it was a little too fatalistic, there is a simple technological
solution to  the problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I've made this little device. A bomb with
a proximity fuse. Not a big bomb, a gut wrenching sort of hand grenade size thing.
And I had my appendix taken out to have it implanted It guess it is more an
anti-proximity fuse. The bomb will detonate if there is ever no one within 5
meters of me. And with people that close, all the time, the touching becomes
inevitable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I have to admit my family has affected my
life. They are the ones that inspired my judicial reforms. You won’t have heard
of them before, that is part of the point. But I’ve been given permission to
talk about them in this book because of its presentation as a work of fiction. My
reforms are currently being implemented in Toronto, Buffalo, Rome and
Amsterdam. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Whenever a person is captured in the act
of committing a first degree felony they are brought to our clinic. We
brainwash the felon to make him or her believe that they never actually
committed the crime. They believe they did all the planning and preparation but
that they chickened out at the last minute. We leave a memory of performing the
crime and the arrest, but as a stylized memory. They would generally describe
it as a bad daydream, part of the reason they chose not to go through with it.
Then we pump them full of depressants and drop them back on the streets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I think the most beautiful thing in the
world is the power of recursive situations. They are left with a memory of
having received our brainwashing treatment. And that part we leave as a very
tangible memory. But we have also planted urban legends about this sort of
treatment into the population, but with an obvious bias of being an example of
standard paranoid delusion thinking. So the felons are left with a very
disturbing memory of having people wrench changes in their reality, a memory
that makes them question their own sanity, a memory they don’t feel comfortable
sharing with others. Something they must bottle up inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>We have a very low recidivism rate.  Part
of our contract with these cities involves planting surveillance equipment into
everyone we process and monitoring their progress for the next four months as a
form of insurance. We receive an extra $80,000 per felon to perform this
surveillance. We are supposed to place sub-dermal positional tracking devices
and microphones. We have built a control center in each city. But we don’t
actually bother doing any of the surveillance; it would really eat away at the
profit margin.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Even though we aren’t doing the
monitoring we do have to have people going in and out of these control centers
on a daily basis as if they were doing real work. So I’ve now got a job to give
to all those distant relatives who have begun to seek me out since I became
famous. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I like to wander the streets with my
walkman going but no headphones, no sound. The first five senses are the most
boring. It’s like a soundtrack to the movie of my life, and just like in the
movies the characters can't actually hear it. I mean, its not that I want my
life to be a movie, its that movies have managed to capture what I want out of
life.</span></p>

you with any background before I describe the commercial. If it needs setting
up, then obviously it sucks as a commercial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>This is exclusive news footage of an
early prototype for a Home Hardware commercial, scheduled for 1997.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The above will be used as an opening
title. There will be no dialogue and no other captions throughout the
commercial until the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>It will begin with a young woman happily
strolling down a sunny street with a red bag labeled Home Hardware. This red
bag will be fairly flat, about a foot square. It won’t be empty, but light
enough that it isn’t any sort of burden for the woman carrying it. She will
have some sort of uniform on as well, although this will be more obvious only
when one sees a different person in the same ‘uniform’.  This woman will come
up to a person lying on one of those sliding trays underneath his car. It will
be choreographed well enough that she doesn’t have to alter her pace to pull an
item out of her bag as she comes up to him, and hand it into his hand as he
half slides out and reaches up. You will never see his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>She will meet up with a colleague (same
outfit and bag) at the next street corner and they will smile at each other and
go up to a front door. He (the colleague) will ring the doorbell.  A young
mother will answer the door, invite them in. They will walk into the living
room and attach their two magic bags together so that they can pull out a fully
assembled children’s sized easel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>They will walk out the door and split up.
The camera will follow the man. He will continue down the street. He will pass
one child and hand her one end of a skipping rope. It will trail out of his bag
as he walks. He will reach down and pass the other end to another child as he
passes her. He will stop, make a small private grin, take two backward steps,
jump over the skipping rope (that the children haven’t begun to twirl yet) and
continue forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He will notice a woman who has stepped
out her front door and is gesturing to him. He will go to the house and into
the bathroom to find a faucet half disassembled. He will reach into his bag and
brings out a small washer. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The woman will take the washer, which
will fit perfectly, and will quickly finish re-assembling the faucet. She will
turn to the man and shake his hand. He will lean in and whisper in her ear. She
will laugh, nod and walk out of the bathroom, leaving him in there, closing the
door as she leaves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Closing caption: Now that we’ve given up
the pretense of stores, and take the magic straight to you, we hope that
occasionally you will allow us to use your bathrooms. Thanks. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And I have a slogan for another
commercial.  Just haven’t found the product yet:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

lang=EN-US>I like to walk the sidewalk like a tightrope</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>A simile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>My life is like a bus trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Not some little city bus ride. I am a
happy guy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I had an earlier version of this where I
said my life was a trip on one of Magic Bus Inc’s wild rides on old school
buses. Overland from London to Bombay in 7 to 10 weeks, depending on wars. And
in Afghanistan the bus would drop down into a valley, a valley with a six foot
ground fog of death, the final moist exhalations of thousands of dying
children. And I would ride on top of the bus above this fog. I would rescue a
woman too, and spend days just holding her, squeezing her. Squeezing the stench
of death out of her, scraping it off her skin and then bathing her with my own
sweat having run out of clean water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And so on. You get the flow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But my life isn’t like that really. Other
people have described their lives in some paraphrasing of the above. They’re
fooling themselves too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>My life is like a Greyhound bus trip from
Ottawa to Vancouver. Not really that long. Not really that far. But enough to
seem like eternity along the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And stop after stop after stop. It seems
like you are always standing still. Except sometimes the bus will make a big
jump ahead. Six or eight hours on the road. And then when it finally does stop
you have forgotten what that feels like. And you get off the bus and almost
fall because the world isn’t rushing by. You spend the 10 minute break just
leaning against a wall and people mistake it for being cool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And the bus windows. The bus windows are
my existentialism (to be removed in case of emergency). The toilet at the back
that nobody uses, but keeps your bladder from bursting just because it is
there. That is my United Church upbringing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And Vancouver. Vancouver is like death.
I’m not being cruel. I’ve been there. It’s true. A sickly Christian heaven that
is just a bland version of hell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So the journey’s the thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>(This is going well, better than I
though. I might be able to upgrade it, call it an analogy).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And back in the days before, back when
all of me was always at least half engorged. I was traveling through forests
and lakes and life was everywhere and it seemed ...  I don’t know, it just
seemed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The change is gradual. When you finally
realize you are in the prairies you can’t even recall how long ago it might
have started. And this is when lots of people (guys especially) hop off the bus,
steal a red convertible and head northeast back in search of the Canadian
shield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But I was born in the prairies so I know
what to look for. I was born middle-aged, in a geography with no limits but
your eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I could go on, but I’d have to start making
things up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>There is an indescribable art in waking
up in the morning feeling happy, an art requiring no skill what so ever. It is
a tribute to my idiocy that I continue to try and write poetry about this. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I had a teacher in high school, physics,
and we were studying momentum, and he brought in a brick one day and spent
about half an hour slowly and carefully building up a model of his arm pivoting
from his elbow at a certain speed (estimating the speed from shadows, and
spinning arms), creating a certain amount of momentum, enough momentum to smash
the brick apart, but just enough, so that the brick would absorb the momentum
of his hand. The destruction cushioning the blow, smoothly and safely. He had
never tried this before. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And then he did it, just to prove that he
actually believed in science. And the first blow didn't actually smash the
brick, in the end it even broke a bone, but before the pain had even started he
corrected his mistake (don't look at the brick, your brain doesn't understand
physics, it will abandon you at the last second, try and slow your hand down,
which is much worse, in the end). He swung again and smashed the brick. And you
could almost see the halo around his head. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And you know, we used to take these big
american driving holidays. Four of us in a rented lincoln, trunk stuffed, the
lid barely latched, riding half an inch up around the edges. And we saw this
road one time, a forest service road in Idaho, and it looked like it went
straight up, so we took it. With a full tank of gas, and over inflated tires
for extra traction, and the air conditioning off (for extra torque). And
everyone terrified except for me, even my brother scared, driving. And at the
top of the road was a parking lot, and a rocky path, and we left the car
wheezing from some safety pressure valve somewhere, and we climbed up (in
thongs, unwilling to open the trunk merely for shoes). And half an hour up we
came to a fire lookout. And you could see parts of four states from there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And all I could think of was sitting up
on such a peak for months and months. Trying to become a saint, trying to make
such beauty enough for me. Exploring the edges of my insanity. Learning that
you can't really fall off a mountain. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I contemplated that for about 10 minutes,
until I got bored. And that was 5 minutes longer than anyone else, so I seemed
like a poet. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Maybe the thing I’m most proud of in my
life is having single-handedly caused the resurgence of popularity in the old
Dick Van Dyke show in the metropolitan area of Toronto. An old friend of mine
has ridden this wave to big time success. His most recent theme party had more
than 3,000 attendees dressed up as Danny Thomas alone. People ask me if I’m
jealous. My part in the process is pretty unsung. But Tom always lets me into
the parties for free, and more importantly into the cool sub, pre and post events.
And I must admit at the risk of appearing masculine that anything that makes
women try and be  like Mary Tyler Moore is a good thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i><span lang=EN-US>it was only a romantic notion that it </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i><span lang=EN-US>reflex.  I spent the few seconds </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i><span lang=EN-US>admiring a real yellow, the colour of</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i><span lang=EN-US>a faded gum wrapper lying in the</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>O.K. That’s not strictly true. I did ride
my bike every day to work. And sometimes I would dress inappropriately for the
temperature in the morning because I knew it would be warmer by the afternoon
and on those days I would have to ride extra hard to stay warm. And I did
follow the route described above.  And I did go through the red light at the
bottom of the hill every time.  And if I was pedaling really hard and kept up
my speed on the straight-away after the hill then I could make it through the
yellow light of the left turn signal at the next intersection. A wide two lane
turn that I would still have to take with my knee almost scraping dust because
of my speed. And one day my tire did explode just as I was about to start that
turn. And I did just lock the back brakes and pump the front brakes and come to
an entirely controlled stop as the light turned red.  I was pretty impressed
with myself at not cracking my skull but I certainly was too occupied to notice
something in the ditch. Luckily this intersection was almost at my office so I
just dismounted and carried my bike the last block and a half.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>If I were called Johnny Steam I might
have had additional limbs attached. It’s not that I feel a need for extra
limbs. I mean sometimes when I’m fixing my bicycle I will pick up tools with my
feet if it would be awkward to bend down. And I must admit I wouldn’t mind
having slightly more useful feet. I don’t think I would care about the full
functionality of an opposable toe but slightly longer toes certainly wouldn’t
hurt. I’m not comfortable calling this a need though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But if I were called Johnny Steam I would
have extra limbs attached just for the experience (and to try to build up a
false sense of family connectedness). As each aunt or cousin died I would have
one of their fingers added to my feet. I would probably remove a toe at the
same time (replace the toe with a finger) so that I could still wear store bought
shoes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And whenever a brother or parent died I
would take a whole limb, an arm, and have that attached. The medical aspect is
actually more straightforward than the moral and legal issues.<a href="#_ftn1"

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I have two parents and two brothers so if
I outlive them all I would have three arms on each side. I’ve decided I would
take Francis’s left arm, but I’m still not sure for the others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I haven’t discussed this with them. I
don’t really want to raise the issue because all of them are pretty sharp
people. I’m sure any discussion would end with the question of how I would feel
about having their head transplanted onto my shoulder after their body fails. I
don’t have a reason I feel comfortable with but I’m not willing to do that at
all. They’re nice people but I don’t want to live with any of them 24 hours a
day. I imagine maybe Francis and I could come up with some sort of arrangement
that we both could live with, but it seems to be a slippery slope. I don’t
think I could say yes only to him.  I am unwilling to end my days as a torso
hanging from padded ropes covered in heads like warts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

dolls and figurines I could find that cost less than $1.50. I bought them in
all sexes and styles.  I customized each one (according to the following poem),
put then in a paper bag from a liquor store and put them out on display. If you
bought one hold on to it. You can never tell how much they might be worth

word family. There had never been a distinction before between those people you
lived with who weren't related by parents, and those who were. His new word was
actually a pun on the words for slavery and suckling. You can't judge such an
act of creation by its consequences. It is a stroke of a god who feels the
right to make the world as he sees fit. Johnny could see no reason not to be
such a god.</span></i></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>Stationery</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I used to do all my writing on graph
paper. And I used to write fairy tales that started like:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>There once existed a kingdom where there
lived a princess that satisfied the condition that whenever she knew that there
existed a prince who she would love if and only if he had first determined a
location such that it was guaranteed there existed a living dragon within 200
metres of that location they she would be happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The spring of the year that I was in
grade three I decided the world was just like books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I read lots of  books about space ships
and outer space and stuff like that. And I found a patch of dandelions out on
the school playground. I mean, the school playground was all dandelions, but, I
identified a small section of this that accurately and completely encoded a
description of our solar system. It wasn’t a simple map. I was a math wizard
sort of kid. It encoded (through the position of the clumps, and the number of
flowers in each clump) for each of the nine planets its position from the sun
and its number of moons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Now, as in other things I have mentioned
from my childhood, a short description of an aspect of the North American
prairies might be useful. Green lawn sort of grass doesn’t grow naturally
there. It requires extensive watering. People do that sort of thing for their
own yards, and it is even done for some special public parks, but something
like a school playground is left more natural for ease of maintenance. Natural
prairie grasses grow together in little bunches from 2 to 8 inches across<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Century Schoolbook",serif;color:black'>[2]</span></a>. In between
these bunches is just bare dirt, which erodes a little. So these bunches are
tiny hills too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So, when I talk about clumps of
dandelions it doesn’t involve the sort of arbitrary grouping one could do on a
continuous lawn. A clump was a non-negotiable thing. Of course, the grouping of
clumps into bunches remained open to interpretation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I mean, in the end I don’t in any sense
believe that god was giving me a sign. I didn’t think he was back then either.
And I also don’t think I would be able to see that encoding now if I saw the
same dandelions. Of course, I wouldn’t get the same thing out of a grade 3
level book on the solar system either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Later that same summer I spent three days
collecting long grass from the various ditches near my house. I would only
collect yellow grass more than a foot tall. And I would collect it into bundles
and tie them up like sheaves. I even talked a friend (well, not really a
friend; I didn’t like him) to help me. We had collected quite a few sheaves
(for eight year olds) before my mom made us stop. I couldn’t explain why I was
doing it, but then I didn’t know why farmers did it either.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>Johnny Steam Toys with his Emotions</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Johnny had never played both sides in a
game of chess. It was easy enough to find a partner for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The first letter arrived scented with
sweet peas, Russian thistle and ivory soap. The envelope parchment. A stamp
featuring an old cathedral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He had written it with his left hand. It
was a faintly familiar childish handwriting. It was from Evangeline, a woman of
his imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Like wearing clean underwear in case of
an accident, he had picked an entirely fictitious name. He knew some of his
female friends worried that he might be obsessed with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>This first letter was set in Spain,
Valencia. She described her days wandering the countryside. It’s a great place
to hike, no bugs, almost a deafening heat, but an oasis of orange trees every
couple of miles. And you can steal all the oranges you want. None of the
farmers have the energy to bother chasing you. After a couple of days of a solely
orange diet (food and drink) the diarrhea is pretty intense, but as long as
you're by yourself its ok.  And it only lasts a couple of days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The second letter was stained with red
wine. She had finally run into a young rancher willing to chase her for his
oranges. They were living together in a white plaster building, clay tile roof,
no glass in the windows. The rancher's tame bull would stand at the window and
look in as they played at sex on his duck feather mattress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The third letter Johnny wrote late at
night, drunk from an evening spent in a strip bar. She was bored of the
rancher. And the rancher was only in love with the sex. She talked of when she
had first heard of Johnny, word of mouth from an ex-roommate.  And why she had
started to write to him, but that part was hard to understand, almost
religious. She seemed to be thinking it was one of those spiritual connection
things that are sometimes used to try and mask simple lust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The fourth letter, she was back on the
road again, and back to the cities.  And out of Spain. She had caught a ride
with a Pepsi machine repair man on his way to a crisis in northern Greece. 800
miles in 19 hours with $4000 of speeding tickets and 5.4 grams of cocaine. Two
days after they had arrived she was still pacing the sea wall in Thesaloniki,
her nose still bleeding.  She was staying at the youth hostel, making room and
board by low-tech forgery.  Her goal in life was to acquire a taste for cheap
Greek pine flavored wine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Her fifth letter, Johnny had to question
its truthfulness. She claimed to have walked all the way to Athens. Her
description of the city was very superficial, as if she'd only ever seen
brochures, or maybe a low-altitude fly-over. She said he could send her a reply
care of the American Express there. It was the first time she'd mentioned a
two-way communication. Johnny didn't bother sending a reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Her sixth arrived postmarked Istanbul.
Johnny threw it away unopened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The seventh came from Prague. She was
high on intellectualism. Minds were boiling over in the vacuum of freedom. Art
was life. Anarchy was her religion. The letter went on for 15 pages. And the
paper, exquisite, hand made, scraps of bus transfers barely visible. She was
living on baguettes, chocolate and weak tea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The eight and ninth letters came from
Prague as well. She was living the examined life. She appeared much more calm
and cool. She was happier than she'd ever been.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But the air in Prague was yellow and her
lungs had begun to ache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The tenth letter was short. It just said
when her plane would arrive. Johnny had even phoned a travel agent for
information so he could use real flight times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He went out to the airport when the day
came, even though he knew she wouldn't be on the plane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He would open a beach-front restaurant
with shutters and no glass. And drinks with four ounces per, so toxic he would
have to buy his little umbrellas with glass stems so they wouldn’t dissolve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And whenever there was a break, the
restaurant completely empty, he would pour himself a glass of tea take his notebook
and sit at a table by the window.  And when a customer came in he would let
them seat themselves, and let them just relax for a few minutes until they were
just about to leave. Then he would get up and walk over and laugh with them,
say the owner had run out a few minutes ago just to say a quick hello to a
lover, “obviously there has been some sort of delay” but Johnny knows where
everything is pretty much and he’s sure the owner would be happy if they all
just made themselves at home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And sometimes they would be too upset at
the delay and leave anyways, but Johnny didn’t need customers like that.
Usually they would stay. Johnny can be quite disarming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And a few hours later these first
customers would be helping more recent arrivals. And someone would be trying to
get people to have a milkshake or a frothy rum punch or something like that
because he wants another chance to use the mixer (which is just like the one at
the soda counter in Woolworth’s when he used to go with his dad, that he never
got to use, back then).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And when someone decided they finally did
have to leave, Johnny would dig up an old creased menu that actually didn’t
have any of the specific things the customers had made. And he would leave it
up to them to choose an amount. Except if they decided to leave way too much,
then Johnny would make them take some back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He would get a bunch of repeat business
but the tourists would never stay on the island for more than two weeks, so few
would figure out the deception. And those that did would usually just be
tremendously amused. One time a famous writer from Oregon would come down and
figure it all out and come in and make a big scene, very irate. After she would
leave Johnny would explain that this was a local custom, a gesture of respect. The
patrons would be excited to have such a story to take home with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And he would call the restaurant Sun, not
‘The Sun’ and not Son with an o. He would claim it was called that when he
bought it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And it would be on the west side of the
island to get the sunset. And the island would be two miles across, from east
to west, at that point. So he would see the sun rise over the water every
morning as well, but not without some effort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And he would tell all his neighbors that
his notebooks were filled with them, that he was writing down their story. But
he would never let them see, claiming there was no need, that they knew all he
was learning, all that he was writing, already.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>They wouldn’t have even been interested
in his scribblings if he hadn’t withheld them, made them secret. This mystery
would create a small vacuum, small but persistent. And this vacuum would draw
out a mythology from them. They would create the stories supposedly stolen from
his notebooks. Some supposedly read by candlelight as he slept drunkenly
unaware in the next room. Some overheard as pillow talk between himself and the
moon. Some constructed from snippets heard repeated by parrots. Some written in
the tea leaves at the bottom of his cups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>They would laugh at him good naturedly
because of his fanciful nature, his imagination, the flaws and invisible truths
in the stories they claimed he had written.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And on the first day of spring they would
bring him a new notebook and a pen, always of some bright colour. And for some
reason no one could recall, these things would be brought by all the children
of the island as a group, although they wouldn’t dress up for it. He would
offer them all a glass of champagne, and they would accept. He would serve them
7-Up. They would sit quietly for half an hour (an eternity) and then run off
and play solidly until twilight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I wish I could tell you the stories of
this mythology but they would be private stories, not to be told to strangers.
All I can say is that among this mythology would be a story about Johnny, who
wished he was the sun, who came to the island for all the wrong reasons, who
never got around to leaving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I have my PC set up so that the afternoon
sun doesn’t reflect off the screen. I like to play Doom. My favorite weapon is
the shotgun. Others prefer the chaingun or the plasma rifle. They have more
destructive power. But the double barreled combat shotgun is just right,
aesthetically. Whey you fire it the screen shudders with the recoil. And the
bad guys are thrown backwards as they die. And then the perfect sound of the
barrels breaking open, KACHUNK. You can feel the fluid motion in your shoulder
as you reload and swing the barrel back up, CLICK, to fire again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But I can’t play the game that long
anymore, the tendons in my wrist begin to ache. I’m not a young man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I like it in the summer because I can go
out on the balcony then. And blow bubbles.  I usually start out slow and calm.
Blow a few and watch them meander. Play with the wind. And my mind wanders, to
the impermanence of bubbles. Would I bother making them if they didn’t have
such a short life? And I am a little addictive, so I usually notice, just
before I am about to hyperventilate, that I have been making bubbles non-stop.
And I stop, and look at myself surrounded, and let them settle, and pop. And
then I start up again. And repeat. Until my lungs begin to ache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Then I go inside and make chocolate (it’s
easy: butter, cocoa and icing sugar)(icing sugar is important for that touch of
corn starch).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So I sit motionless and quiet during

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>There were some secret papers relating to
Jack Kennedy’s death that were smuggled into Canada shortly after the incident
for safe-keeping. They were hidden in a titanium capsule in a river bank cave
on the South Saskatchewan river. My brother and I found this capsule in the
early seventies. We were actually looking for a cave mentioned in one of the
Farley Mowat books set in Saskatoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>We never told our parents about it. We
sold the titanium lid immediately and spent two years living solely on banana
flavored mojos. Our parents never figured out how we could be gaining so much
weight when we never ate at home and they had already cut off our allowance. We
sold the tube during the titanium crisis of 1979. It is my running away and
hiding in a south american country with endless rum and beautiful women money.
It makes me comfortable saying what is truly on my mind. What I think is the
truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>For the longest time I didn’t actually
think that the notes in the capsule where true. I mean, I believed them to be
factually correct. They just seemed to be inherently misleading.  But maybe now
society has matured to the point where this information should be known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Jack Kennedy spent two hours each evening
as a young man sitting in a low backed chair intently reading a book. And
randomly, every two or three days, the pastry chef (who was very light on his
feet and could approach soundlessly) would whack Jack quite hard in the head
with a broom handle, sometimes from the front, sometimes the back or the sides.
Jack’s peripheral vision wasn’t very good to begin with (and actually became
worse with the repeated head injuries) so he would never get any advanced
warning of these blows. This process continued until Jack had managed to
acquire the autonomic skill of actually having his head recoil back towards the
source of the blow rather than be pushed by the blow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>This served him well in his boxing career
in college. The second blow almost never landed on him, because no opponent
ever really figured out where his head would be after the first blow.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And it left him with the well muscled
neck that worked such wonders in the televised political debates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Of course, it added to the confusion of

lang=EN-US>My Life Story as written by Tom Robbins</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>It’s short because, well, Tom Robbins
doesn’t really like me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>There is a spot in Ohio. Johnny Appleseed
had passed by the spot in 1740 as he took a detour towards some smoke in the
distance. He had run out of tea a number of weeks earlier and although he
learned many recipes from the Indians of the Ohio valley for making medicinal
and recreational teas from indigenous plants they had all tasted bitter to him,
like spicy dirt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He hoped that whoever was at the smoke
would have some English or Indian tea. And although Johnny didn’t have any
money he had been successful in the past at trading on his fame, showing people
his clippings from the New Jersey newspapers and retelling his stories until
his hosts would give him whatever he wanted, and he would go on his way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So this was what was on his mind as he
sat by the creek to take a short rest. He found that the dynamics of these
visits always went better when he arrived well rested.  But the ground he was
sitting on was very unruly, full of thistles and wild flowers and other useless
plants. And he couldn’t resist his urge to spend an hour and pull them all out,
burn them, and plant one of his precious apple seeds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And it was the third generation child of
this tree in 1910, a total of 47 feet from where Johnny had planted the seed,
under which Frank Strom sat on an equally hot day thinking about the school
dance that evening. Thinking and lazing, and eating the big juicy apples that
hung down so low on the branches he didn’t even have to stand up to pick them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately, these apples were still
green. And it was that evening just after Frank had built up the courage to ask
Janet to dance and she had said yes, that he realized the intestinal degree of
his gastronomic mistake that afternoon. He tried to soldier through it. He
began the dance. But he had to run away before it was done. And he didn’t have
the guts to tell Janet why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And it was a horrible night, best not
discussed in detail. He fell asleep lying in the bushes, comforted by the cool
chill of the damp ground, too exhausted to make it home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>When he awoke the sun had been up for
more than an hour and he, the ground and the bushes were all dry. He stretched
and all his joints cracked, even his back, a series of pops like tearing off
the strip on the top of a new box of cereal. His stomach was calm. He was
hungry, and happy. He smiled, at no one in particular.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And then he remembered the night before,
and Janet, and wondered if she, or anyone else, had heard him groaning and
grunting in the bushes. And he realized he couldn’t face anyone in his home
town every again. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He headed off in the same direction as
Johnny Appleseed had 170 years before, northwest. He had a different
destination though. Frank was heading for the fabled mountains of Saskatchewan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And James Spyker was  born in 1963, a
third generation child of Frank Strom on the farm he had homesteaded fifty
years before. The farm was on the Caderre river. The river flowed through the
farm with banks 45 feet deep, and fairly steep. This was the closest thing to a
mountain that Frank had been able to find in Saskatchewan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately for our story, nothing
worth mentioning ever happened to James Spyker during his lifetime. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Now, if we weren’t saddled by the
structure of a conventional narrative, there is a weeping willow tree that
James could see out of his bedroom window that could tell some tales. It could
keep you amused and intrigued for days if it wanted to. But one musn’t digress.

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>2) Francis feels that the United States
should be a set of dangerous inner cities and Mayberry suburbs joined by
interstate highways running through textureless plains. Otherwise television
would be misleading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>3) Francis and Johnny rented a car once
in Holland. But everything was just too close together. There was too big a
risk in stopping, maybe only 1 kilometer before the perfect place. They
returned the car after 8 hours with 917 kilometers on it. There wasn't a
surcharge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>4) Ivy sniffs delicately at her armpits,
then at his.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;What makes you so sure we aren't
rotting?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>5) If the rules of the Atomic Energy
Commission were followed special training would be required to deal with more
than a single garbage can full of potash. Francis grew up 80 feet over a 2 mile
thick layer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>6) Francis likes to dance. Most Saturday
afternoons he spends in the mall, wandering cross current and variable speed,
invisible catalyst splitting all the happy loving couples down the middle, hand
from hand, as he whistles songs from Fred Astaire's early solo musicals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>7) Francis always takes an orchid with
him on a second date, but sometimes when he ends up confused or flustered, he
doesn't give it to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>8) Francis likes to sit at his kitchen
window in the morning, looking out upon the city and watching all the street
lights go out. Then he eats the orchid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;One for the pot and two for the
cook&quot; was his motto when he cooked with wine. He'd call it Beef Bourgione
because the wine was red, but it was really just a stew, and he didn't bother
with a recipe when he cooked a stew.  That had been one of the things that had
always bothered Joan. Even when he was using a recipe he would measure with the
regular spoons and use the small glasses that looked as if they must hold about
a cup. She would glare at him when he brought in a loaf cake only an inch and a
half high, and only manage to hide her anger when everything turned out
perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But he didn't mind. If she wanted to
spend her time being mad, who was he to judge? </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He missed her anger, even after only two
days. The suddenness of her departure had left him unprepared. The small
weekday dinner party they had planned a couple of weeks ago had become a
homecoming celebration. He had left work at noon to begin preparations. She
would be getting back just in time to eat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The vegetables were finished giving up
their water so the broth was thin and almost reached the top of the pot. It was
at a perfect simmer, slowly sputtering away, covering the stove with a red
rash. The wine had made him hungry already, but the heavy aroma of the stew was
enough to appease it. Uncleanness was another thing that had always bothered
Joan, but not untidiness. She left piles of papers around the house like bread
crumbs, but all the piles got dusted once a week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He put the lid on the pot, knocked back
another glass of wine and got out the vacuum cleaner. He did a thorough job, as
was his habit, moving all the chairs and tables to get underneath and around.
The stem vase with its flowers (dried, from their garden last year) had been
pushed too near the edge of the table, to make way for a stack of magazines. It
might have survived the fall to the carpeting, but he made a stumbling move to
try and catch it that sent it smashing into the wall. &quot;Damn!&quot; He took
up the vacuum again and flipped the beater bar upside down. He brought it
crashing down on the remains of glass and flowers on the carpet. A few more whacks
and it was all in small bits.  He flipped the beater bar back upright and
sucked up all the shards and petals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Cleaning done, he was back to the stew.
It was thicker now. The bubbles were bigger and slower. It looked almost alive,
like a witch's brew. He stirred it around, searching for the bay leaf. She was
always embarrassed if it made it to the table. &quot;What is or guest supposed
to do? Leave it at the edge of his plate like a bone from some fast food
chicken?&quot; But she demanded no more of him than she did of herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The stew was ready to rest now. He shut
off the burner. The guests would be arriving shortly. He laid the table, put
some Charlie Parker on the stereo and opened another bottle of wine to
breathe.  He turned the oven to high and got the pan of biscuits from the
fridge. When he opened the oven door he noticed the absence of the waft of
heat. The pilot light was out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He went back to the kitchen table and
poured himself another glass of wine. He sat down to wait.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The smell was awful, and he had a headache
in a couple of minutes.  He laid his forehead against the cool top of the
kitchen table. But the cool seemed to make his head throb. He drained his
glass, filled it, and drained it again. He immediately realized that that had
been a mistake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The nausea started in the back of his
throat. He could feel it slide down into his stomach. He fell to his knees and
vomited all that he contained.  It was primarily a pool of wine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He stumbled to the patio door of the
kitchen and managed to open it and get out into the back yard. He fell down
into the grass.  It was a warm spring day, with a pleasant breeze, and he was
feeling much better in only a couple of minutes. The excitement had even
sobered him up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He first dashed into the kitchen to turn
off the stove, with his undershirt pulled up to cover his mouth. He waited
outside again for about five minutes, and then went back in the house to open
all the other windows up.  He couldn't smell the gas at all anymore, but he
knew that his sense of smell might be a bit out of whack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He waited another ten minutes, but by
then it was getting close to when his guests might start to arrive.  While
still outside he lit a match and held it far out in front of him as he
approached the kitchen door. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He managed to get inside with no
explosion.  He lit the pilot light on the stove and got the biscuits cooking. 
Then he got the bucket and mop from the basement and cleaned up the vomit.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>She would be pleased that he had mopped
the kitchen floor.</span></p>

to be when I grow up</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I want to be a technology stylist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>For example. A device that would contain
a GPS, a geographic database of phone booths and a couple of cell phones. You
carry this around and if you get a call it would figure out where you were and
ring the nearest pay phone. So if you are wandering around and a pay phone rings
you could just pick it up and it would probably be for you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>It is not a useful device at all really.
But it would be cool. I could make a single copy of it for about $20,000 if you
could live with it being the size of a small notebook computer, $40,000 to make
it the size of a large cell phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>This is just an example idea for such
cool stuff. If someone steals this idea, from this book, and manages to make
one or even sell one they are making money for me anyway, helping to create the
marketplace. I have a million gadget ideas just as good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>As your personal technology stylist I
would just hang out with you for a little while, a few days (at $105 per hour),
and then I would provide you with a plan detailing some concepts for custom
devices and paraphernalia that I feel would suit you. There is no guarantee
that any of these devices will ever make your life more efficient or easy but
they will be no more of a burden than an ankle length stovepipe dress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And I have specific ideas for a few
people already. You’ll pardon my indulgence but it seemed easier to just
include these ideas here than trying to track down all their individual
addresses. The people on this list are all fairly well known. If you don’t
consider yourself well known then you may choose to skip ahead to the next
chapter.  It is up to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Uma Thurman: A short wave radio tuned to
a wavelength of about 1 metre, the average length of the headphone wires of a
personal stereo device. And this radio would transmit not your heart beat
itself, but the surging sound of your blood going through the exit valve of the
left ventricle. And this sound wouldn’t be transmitted through the sound of the
earphones themselves, but directly as a wave into the brain. And this wouldn’t
actually in any way change the effect you have on people. This would be
something just for yourself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Mark Leyner: You would carry an
unobtrusive transmitter that would serve as a homing beacon for a set of small
object-avoiding hovercraft. They would circle around you like a pack of small
lap dogs. They would be very careful to never actually collide with any object
that itself was moving less that 20 miles per hour. Nonetheless, as they
approached a person they would naturally have to direct a stream of air in the
direction of that person in order to brake to a stop. People would find this
very disturbing, but would feel uncomfortable directly objecting to it. These
hovercraft would serve the same purpose as an entourage in providing you with
an appropriate buffer from the thronging masses, without blocking your view.
They could also be used to store cold beverages. I expect with current
technology you would have to remain somewhat aware of where you were walking,
staying away from the very edges of sidewalks to avoid losing these hovercraft
in traffic, but that shouldn’t be a problem for someone with your skills. You
seem very cognizant of your surroundings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Tom Schneider: For you I would create
another system based on cellular phones, as I would guess you are someone who
tools around the city a fair bit. The cell phone would transmit your location
to a base unit though. The bulk of the device wouldn’t travel with you. It does
seem to me that you like to travel light. I could make the device you had to
carry no larger than a cigarette case.  All the base unit would do is make
unobtrusive calls (with a soft generated voice) to anyone of your friends who
happened to be sitting near you (with their cellular phones) to let them know
of your presence. There would specifically be no way of your determining who it
was that had received these calls, so the friend would still be able to
comfortably not look for you if they were otherwise engaged or not in the mood.
This piece of technology would probably be priced high as it would involve the
illegal act of breaking into the logging system of the cellular distributors in
your area. Other than that act, it is of course just a simple matter of
comparing numbers against your personal list of friend’s cell phone numbers.
The system would only notify people that made or received two or more calls
from the cell you are currently in (so as not to disturb people just driving
by).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Patti Smith: Nothing complicated or
particularily modern or elegant. Simply a low power transmitter that would work
at about the same 60 Hertz as the North American power grid. The frequency
would be off just enough to create a beating effect in the overlapping waves.
Almost every device in the world would be entirely unaffected by this beating.
The single exception being the flourescent light bulb. Flourescent bulbs would
dim by about 75% within a ten foot radius of you and the transmitter.  This
would also be available in a 50 Hertz model for use in Europe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Henry Rollins: An electric collar which
would respond to the volume and tone of your voice. As your voice became louder
or more insistent the collar would retract, become tighter.  It might also
choose to retract randomly.  There would be no mechanism to ensure the collar
wouldn’t retract sufficiently to cause death. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I’ve got more ideas. I’ve presented these
few just to prove that fact.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>My Iliad, the lost years</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Dan and I were prisoners of our feet in a
padded cell on the most beautiful beach on the island  of Corfu, a petrified
boat looming off the shore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>We marked time by bread. The days were
fresh, crusty,  stale, hard and then fresh again (Well, sometimes there were
two hard days before fresh came back).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I was aimlessly waiting either for the
jagged gouge on my sole to heal, or for my only pair of shoes to reappear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Imagine the walk up the hill to the bus
stop, the 45 minute ride (standing up) to the only town on the island, and then
wandering around the town looking for a shoe store, all with filthy bare feet
and newspaper stuck to the bottom by dried blood to act as a bandage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>It was much easier to stay at the pink
palace, lying on the beach, drinking Coca Cola and beer and watching a passing
stream of the idle young rich.  And tending  after Dan, who had woken up one
morning with two sprained ankles and no particular memory of it (a prestigious
feat).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The ketchup had begun to ferment at the
end of August. By the middle of September we had to be careful when opening it
as it would ooze up out of the bottle onto the table. It seemed to be an
acquired taste, but I don't think we were eating it to be noticed, we were
already that.  Nor for the alcohol, we were far from poor, and with beer a buck
a quart and free ouzo each night from a stew pot if you were willing to have a
few plates smashed over your head, we were always as drunk as we wanted to be. 
We were just used to the ketchup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Even Doc George was giving us a cut off
our room rates, and his dad would sneak us free goat sandwiches for lunch.  We
were a lost leader.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But it all ended with a whimper.  Dan
still wasn't healed, but he had to get to an American Express office, so Jen
drove him to the boat which would get him to the train.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>My shoes reappeared one day beside the
kitchen.  The next day I went into town and bought the cheapest ticket I could
find to Northern Europe.  It was on the Czechoslovakian airline.  Ren and I (he
on his way back to Finland where his first opera was about to open) sat in the
town square drinking fizzy yellow stuff, counting ugly white leather shoes. 
When we reached 50 we left for the airport.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Sometimes</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the
night and realize I am going to die. I mean not right then, but eventually. And
it takes me awhile to get back to sleep. But I finally do. And the next morning
I always wake up extra happy, maybe just because I did wake up. The amount of
time it’s taking to get back to sleep has gotten shorter in the last few years.
This night fear probably only lasts five minutes these days. Let me try and
tell you why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I don’t know a lot about my ancestors. I
mean I’m sure they had bad teeth, open sores and strong thighs like most folk a
few hundred years ago. There is one ‘tale’, an oral tradition, of some gypsies
in my past. Gypsies living in Sherwood Forest, in England, around the time of
the mythical Robin Hood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>That forest was a pretty lively place
back then. One of the few places you could still live off of hunting in
Britain. So it was the home of all the anarchists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>My ancestors, their thing was patience.
Their major tool was waiting. And self control. They taught their kids hard. As
soon as they could speak they were allowed to ask for anything they wanted. And
as long as it was reasonable they would get it. But part of the asking was that
after making the request they had to sit still for two hours. Sit motionless
and quiet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And their coming of age thing. The elders
would build a fire in a big pit, let it burn down, cover the ashes with a thin
layer of dirt, so that the dirt would warm up to body temperature. And the
young man or woman would lie down on this ground. And warm wax would be poured
on top of them, covering them entirely. The last thing to be covered was their
nostrils, their nose. And their last intake of breath would be scented with
flowers and honey. And then their nose would be sealed as well. And the elders
would hold the novice down as he or she thrashed about, but through the thick
layer of wax the novice couldn’t feel individual hands, just a sense of the futility
of motion. And once the novice had passed out he or she was left one minute
longer. Then the warm wax was removed from their nostrils and mouth, and they
would begin to breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And they would be awakened in the most
gentle way. With warmth and tender caresses. And they would be told a lie, that
they had been encased in the wax for hours. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And then they were an adult.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And whenever a person died in their tribe
the elders would encase the body in the same way, in wax, and leave it up in a
tree. And the tribe would move on immediately, before even hours had passed.
That was why they were gypsies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But, now that I’ve gone to the trouble of
telling you that, it occurs to me that it isn’t actually relevant to the issue
at hand, me .. and my night fears. I mean, I can come up with all sorts of
weird ways to look at death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Like, I’ve always wanted to write an
episode for one of the Star Trek series, doesn’t matter which one. Where the
pivotal fact is that they realize that each time they use the transporter, the
original instance of themselves dies an agonizing death as the body is blasted
apart by the transporter beam, but the new instance is created without that
memory, its like shredding the original of a document after you have faxed it
to someone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>One of the various godlike species would
point this out to them, this agonizing death, and judge them. And the result
would be that they would agree that in this case  ignorance was valid. And
there would just be a small mechanical change to the transporter system, to
stun the person just before they are blasted apart, so that they don’t feel the
pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And then everything would be back to
normal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Or, a slight plot alternative, at the
judging the Federation defense could be that everyone actually already knows
about the agonizing death thing. It’s just one of the accepted things that no
one talks about, like toilets. This ‘abandonment of an instance’ that happens
in the transporter is considered equivalent to changing your mind.  O.K. this
isn’t as easy to explain. Probably a bit too philosophical for prime time. Let
me give you an analogy, an example from my own life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I went to meet a friend for lunch a
couple of weeks ago. I hadn’t seen her for about four years. And we met and
hugged and ordered some soup, and began to chat. And, as you will recall, it
was pretty close to election time back then, so eventually we weren’t able to
keep away from politics. And back in university, when we met, we have been
pretty similar. But now, she has a family, and a mortgage, and really felt
morally justified in getting that 30% extra. I couldn’t believe it. She wasn’t the
same person at all. I mean, we finished things up politely, and I did let her
pay (I never believe in restaurant bill politics). But on my way home I stopped
at the police station. And filed a missing person’s report. Explained the
situation, that this ‘new’ Diane was obviously responsible for the
non-existence of the ‘old’ Diane I used to know. I was hoping that they would
at least arrest her on manslaughter charges, but it appears that they aren’t
going to do anything at all. It seemed disturbing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But I did think, well, if they aren’t
going to bother with tracking down murders at the moment, because of staffing
issues or whatever, well, if that was the case, it seemed the perfect time to
do something I’ve been meaning to for awhile. So I found this landlord I had
had a few years ago. A real slumlord, I could tell you stories, but.   
Anyways, I did it humanely. There was no pain, the body just collapsed to the
floor. And he had no family, no private life. His relationship with the world
was entirely and solely related to his business. And the business, as soon as
the body was discovered, passed into the hands of a property manager, who is
doing everything wonderfully. So, really, the landlord hasn’t died at all.
There is just this currently unused body lying around, and the landlord has
become a nicer person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Actually, I might explain it a little
differently, but the above is the wording suggested by my lawyer.  The police
are being pretty damn arbitrary. They haven’t charged ‘new’ Diane, but they
have charged me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So, back to the Star Trek thing. The
federation’s defense would be that the transporter thing is like the first case
‘old’ Diane - ‘new’ Diane rather than the second case ‘old’ landlord - ‘new’
landlord.   In some ways its even less horrid than the old-new Diane thing.  I
expect that ‘old’ Diane dies an agonizing death every time ‘new’ Diane buys
another Globe and Mail. At least the transporter thing happens only once per
instance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Another example:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>By the time Jorge was twenty two he was already
considered one of the finest minds in Buenos Aires, and was a sought after
guest for cocktail parties and light supper evenings.  He enjoyed these events,
especially the rich food and beautifully scented women, and he was easily
distracted by the conversations,  delicate constructions of fancies and
theories.  His true passion though was for immortality.  He was unwilling to
believe that his existence was merely temporary.  As a child he had been
thrilled with puzzles of wood and string and metal hoops, removing the hoop
from the string without untying any of the knots.  He liked to convince his
friends that each puzzle was impossible, being formal, starting with facts and
corollaries and building a solid theorem.  Once he had them completely convinced,
he would make the one simple gesture that removed the hoop.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He didn't bother dealing with the
physical, with the body and aging and decay.  A very busy road is almost never
the right path.  He studied Buddhism for awhile, but eventually realized that
its notion of heaven was actually even more abhorrent to him than death.  He
was watching an electrician work one day though, turning lights on and off,
flipping switches, figuring out first what worked and then building from there.
He was watching this electrician work when he had his inspiration, and like his
tricks with the metal hoops, it seemed largely stupid to his friends.  Jorge
took this to be a good sign.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He spent a preliminary year figuring out
exactly how much of himself could become immortal.  He had become a well
respected writer accidentally along the way, which made an obvious starting
point.  In the end it seemed mostly to be about his way of writing and of
thinking, but it wasn't easy to specify.  Luckily that wasn't necessary.  He
needed as much time as possible for the second stage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>For the second stage he merely had to
simplify the view of himself, until he was totally contained within the
immortal bits.  The last few years of his life he claimed to have achieved his
goals, but of course nobody knows.  And, of course, he still died.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Johnny was in a Dunkin' Donuts sipping a
hot chocolate one Tuesday morning when he noticed that the person beside him
was Jorge Louis Borges, sitting with a coffee and a glazed cruller.  Borges
said he found the combination of caffeine and honey kept his memories moist and
pliable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>He didn't look much like the picture from
the dust jacket.  He looked much younger.  And he was black, and a woman.
Actually, it would be more true to say that the young black woman was Borges,
but in the same sense that she was thin or she was cold, not that she was
possessed by some soul sucking psychic vampire. Johnny mentioned this to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>She laughed at these observations, and
began one of her little stories. &quot;There was a young man who lived in
Buenos Aires in the 1890's. He had  a great many lovers, both male and female.
He refused to distinguish between any of them. He called them all Alexa. He
never made dates, but each night he would go to one of their apartments, or he would
go to a bar and search for another Alexa. None of them were pleased by his
behavior, but when their turn came, he was such a good lover, intense as if no
one else existed, that they forgave him. Or if one of them couldn't forgive him
and barred her door against him, he would hardly notice, there was always
another Alexa only a few blocks away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>This did not incite an obvious reply.
After a short pause Johnny said &quot;I've always been fond of natural
disasters, tornadoes especially. They would never come as far north as
Saskatoon though, like crickets, but Regina got lots. I was at an aunt's house
once and I remember seeing the funnel in the distance, dark black like a
thunder cloud, which seemed funny, it was darker than the dirt on the ground.
We stood outside and watched it because my uncle didn't trust the carpentry in
his house.   It didn't make any noise. We sat on squeaky metal chairs, ate
orange popsicles, and watched the tornado go by.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>She asked &quot; How many people were
hurt?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;I don't remember. A few I guess.
Actually, I don't think it ever happened.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Borges smiled again. She ate two bites of
her cruller, licked her fingers, and said &quot;I'm tired. Let me ask you a few
questions. For example, what is the essential difference between dreams and
reality?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Do you believe airline tickets
should be transferable?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Yes, but not in the usual
sense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;When was the last time you
contemplated suicide?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Johnny thought for several seconds before
replying &quot;Well, I mean it’s been awhile since its been an active goal, but
you know, whenever I'm on a balcony or bridge it does occur to me that the self
control keeping me from jumping over the edge is a pretty ephemeral
thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Do you remember your birth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Johnny laughed . &quot;No, my mom
remembers that for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>She smiled again, leaned back in her
chair with a last fragment of her cruller, and said &quot;Why don't you
continue the story for me then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&quot;O.K. &quot; He paused. &quot;The
young man never thought of Alexa during the day. He was a student. He filled his
days reading books and scrolls in Greek and Sanskrit. He discovered many things
and wrote elaborate papers, but he wrote them all in a language of his own
invention, to ensure they would be read only in the proper context. There was
no such thing as 'and then one day' in his life.  Everything continued
regularly until he died at the age of 62, of a heart attack, in the middle of
the night.  It was August, the temperature was 35 degrees Celsius, the body
didn't grow cold. Alexa didn't notice he was dead until the next morning. They
didn't have a public funeral. I found his papers in a tin box at the library,
many years after his death. They intrigued me.  It is a beautiful looking
script. I even found some Alexa's still alive, now old men and women. They were
willing to sleep with me, but it didn't help me to decipher the text. I still
don't understand any of the symbols, but I'm translating it anyway. I've got to
eat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>The young black woman, who no longer
looked anything like Borges, nodded in approval, and took her leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And Borges, in his new body, took out his
wallet and thumbed through the cash and credit cards to see what he had to play
with this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=happyfaces><span lang=EN-US>K</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But, all this death, immortality stuff,
I’ve become a little sidetracked. I don’t think I’ve gotten anything across.
Maybe I should begin again (only differently).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the
night and realize I am going to die. I mean not right then, but eventually. And
it takes me awhile to get back to sleep. But I finally do. And the next morning
I always awake extra happy, maybe just because I did awake. The amount of time

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Again, I think I’ve become a little
sidetracked. I’m not sure I’ve gotten anything across yet. I’ll try one more
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I like to enter a cocktail party through
a side door near the back of the room, at breakneck speed, as if I had a four
foot length of 2x4 held in both hands. And listen to the sound in my brain as
my imaginary 2x4 goes thwack, thwack, thwack across the foreheads of any
partygoers leaning against the wall. And I let this imaginary violence slow me
down, to a respectable striding speed. And then I scan the crowd, checking for
anybody I know. I give myself five seconds. And then calculate my limit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I award myself an extra drink per hour
for every four acquaintances I spot in those five seconds (close friends count
as three acquaintances). My allowance is 3 plus the acquaintance bonus.  (e.g.
If I see 7 acquaintances in my five second scan then my limit is 3 + (7/4) = 5
drinks per hour). So then, off to the bar to drink half my hour’s allowance
right away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>Now, when I’ve described all this before
there has been some confusion. To make things clear. I’m not comfortable at
cocktail parties. I’m not about to get drunk at these things. I always drink
some non-alcoholic cold beverage, whatever they have with the highest caffeine
content. And if I’m not thirsty, or am already abuzz with caffeine from some
chocolate binge or something, I just get really small glasses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I think it is more about forming a
relationship with the bartender, whom, I have discovered experimentally, is
usually the most interesting person at the event. I mean, at least the bartender
has a valid reason for being there. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And after that, after my first drink
binge, I usually just hang around my friends like a lost puppy and wait until I
can comfortably leave. One of my friends even scratches me behind the ears
sometimes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>You know when you're leaving the house.
And you check to make sure the lights are all off, and you have everything you
need. You've got the stuff you're dropping off. And the bank book because the
credit card is due. And you've got the list. The list is important. And a head
full of times. The Saturday brunch ends at 1:30. There's a movie at 4:15 if you
can make it. But better have the wine by then because the store'll be closed
after. Which is why you have the knapsack. To lug it all around. And you think
of her, but there's nothing you can do. But it distracts you for a second and
the cat gets out. So alter the schedule cause you gotta come home between the
movie and the dinner party because he'll probably be cold and willing to come
back in by then. Which maybe means the movie's off. Which maybe means you
should phone them, arrange something, get that over with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I was a couple of hundred feet above the
Don Valley Parkway when I realized that all I am trying to do here is create a
rustic hi-tech fascimile of Arlo Guthrie’s Alice’s Restaurant.  I may not be as
strident as he was, but that’s just a reflection of the diference in telegenics
between Kennedy and Carter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>I was watching one of those New Mexico
Territory westerns that I love, this one staring Renée Zellweger, when I
realized that I have never actually told anyone about the romance I just failed
to notice until way too late, with a woman who Renée always reminds me of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>When the day of wandering ended up with
us at some family dinner of hers, me meeting some cousins (even some in-laws). She
and I and her kids, her unpleasant husband somewhere else. The preceeding mail
exchanges of snippets, snarks and delights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>And me still not realizing maybe she was
willing to have me help solve the problem of the unpleasant husband.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>My guess now is that she mistook my lack
of awareness for a lack of interest, sadly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US> I like to think that she had friends to
talk with about this.  Or maybe even that her relationship with the guy who did
help her solve the problem is one where they do talk with that sort of honesty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>But it isn’t the sort of thing that I
talk about with my friends.  We talk more of philosophy and the things that amuse. 
We don’t seem to list our screwups other than those that entertain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>So instead I write about them, bind them
in leather and try to pawn them off strangers like you.</span></p>

lang=EN-US> You start by rewiring the muscle groups in the lower back so that
connected muscles that are always used together actually use a single nerve
pathway. This multiplexing leaves some pathways free, and these are used to
connect to the new limb. And connecting the veins and arteries and the
lymphatic system is just straightforward plumbing.  They recommend adding an
extra heart for each additional three limbs.   It takes a period of physical
therapy to learn muscular control of the new arm. It is the same therapy as
necessary in the case of debilitating strokes. Some people who have had special
difficulties have had pacemaker like regulators added.  Which these regulators
a single neural command can cause a complex muscle interaction like the
grasping motion of a hand.</span></p>

lang=EN-US> I expect the evolutionary reason for this is that the mini gullies
will make more water pool and absorb into the soil during the infrequent but
heavy prairie rains. I’m sure the network of roots from these clumps actually
infiltrates all of the soil, even below the bare patches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>And, speaking of evolution, I was so
thrilled with myself a few years ago when I figured out the reason for cheese.
Its a way of making milk stay edible longer in the absence of refrigeration.
It’s an obvious food product. You’ve got milk lying around in some container.
You know if you do nothing it will become horrible before you finish it. So you
try all sorts of things to make it last longer. And soon enough you have
cheese. It’s much more inevitable than figuring out how to make bread or a
soufflé or something.</span></p>

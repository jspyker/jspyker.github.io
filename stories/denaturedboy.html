preface</H1>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">You’ll have to forgive me. I’m in
a bad mood.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">As I was leaving my apartment this
morning I tossed a lit match onto a pile of dirty clothes. It just
seemed like nothing less than the sound of sirens would make me feel
like I was awake.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">That’s not strictly true. I did
wake up in a bad mood. But as I was leaving my apartment I thought of
that line. And then I felt better.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">It can be so magic when you think of
the right words at the right time. At least for me. And I guess it's
just because it doesn't happen that often. But, about ten years ago,
I was just hanging around Yonge and Dundas in Toronto, early evening,
and Malcolm McLaren came by in one of those rickshaw things. He and
the driver were sprawled up on the bench, a pack of six uniformed
school girls were pulling the rickshaw.  I just dropped my few bags
of groceries and dashed over, ran alongside, and asked &quot;Mr.
McLaren, would you mind if I asked you a question?&quot; &quot;Well,
(pause), sure.&quot; &quot;What's the best way to make a good first
impression?&quot; And he said &quot;Good question.&quot;, slouched
even farther back and offered me a split of champagne from a cooler
beside him. I declined, already feeling a little nauseated from the
continued running. He thought for ten or fifteen seconds before
replying &quot;Well, first, a general piece of advice, never worry
about fidelity. And second, for a good first impression, my best
advice is always have your entrance accompanied by the sound of
breaking glass.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="happy-faces-western"></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">On a recent business trip to retrieve
antique medical supplies from the beaches on the gulf coast of Texas
I returned to my hotel in Corpus Christi early one evening to
discover about 400 people huddled into a group, being herded by two
college-aged women. I rushed into the gift shop to buy a disposable
camera to capture this oddity but found they were out of cameras, out
of film.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The gardener manning the cash
register in the gift shop told me the whole thing had started about
10 that morning when Ellen and Joanne (the two college students) had
decided to get a picture of themselves at the hotel before they went
home. They had asked one of the hotel maids to take the picture. Then
they’d decided they should get a picture of themselves with the
maid due to her involvement in their trip (through the taking of the
previous snapshot). They’d asked a passing guest to take a picture
of them with the maid.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Of course it had then seemed equally
appropriate to get a picture with their new friend (the guest). So
they had called up a bell hop to take a picture of themselves with
the maid and the guest. And this process had continued until my
return.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Ellen had bought out the gift shop of
all its film and she and Joanne were now busy keeping the crowd
together until the emergency van from Kodak arrived with more.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Never one to shy away from ultimate
responsibility I commandeered the laser printer at the front desk and
ran off some business cards labeling myself as a licensed therapist.
I was able to convince Ellen and Joanne that their entire vacation
experience was actually accurately portrayed already by the 1968
movie length episode of the Brady Bunch (“The Brady Bunch Go to
Hawaii”, available at most Blockbuster Video stores). In fact both
Ellen and Joanne had spent more hours watching Cindy Brady on tv than
they had looking at themselves in the mirror. Cindy was a more
accurate representation of their inner self-image. So they let the
people go.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The hotel comp’d my room and my bar
tab.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This was when I learned the power of
television.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="happy-faces-western"></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And then there was a fast road trip I
took with my brother once. We were heading up to British Columbia to
visit the world’s largest naturally occurring hydro-electric
generator.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">John Fante lent us his car for the
trip. It had a radar detector, a rear-view mirror, everything. He had
been the best rally car driver in the world, before he went blind.
Now he was ranked number three</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We began picking up speed as we came
down from the Sierra Mountains. We were at 80 when we hit Reno. We
slingshotted around the money and sex and were up to 100 by the time
we left the county.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The moon was full, and our lights
didn't give us enough distance anyway, so we shut them off.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">About 40 miles down the road Jack
Kerouac screamed past us in his sister-in-law's 1940 Chevrolet. He
was returning it to her on the coast. The odometer cable left a trail
of sparks as it bounced along behind him. And he wasn't too far ahead
when he turned off, into the Mustang Ranch. He was picking up another
car, or a new woman, it was too dark to tell which.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Half an hour later (we smelled the
ether first) we pulled up along side Dr. Hunter S. Thompson hunched
over the wheel. The dome light was on. A burly Samoan beside him was
fixing something. The engine was whining in the stainless steel,
4-wheel drive Lambourghini. He had his foot to the floor. We wouldn't
have had a chance against him, except the good doctor didn't realize
he was only in third.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Around the corner and over the hill,
was William S. Burroughs, hat on head, cane in hand, thumb out and
up. We almost lost it as the right tires hit the gravel. We reversed
right back to where he was. He looked inside our car, and politely
declined the ride. He waved us on our way, warning us &quot;Never
trust a man with a wallet&quot;.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We were back up to speed, and almost
at our destination when we saw the mail truck stopped, straddling the
line. Again we hit the ditch, aiming for some sage brush to slow us
down. But what really slowed us down was the guy we hit. He flew 40
feet ahead, and to the left. We came to a stop beside him. His pants
were undone, we recognized the dirty shorts and the pock-marked face.
It was Bukowski. He still had vital signs, he would be fine, he'd had
worse. We left our last two bottles of red wine beside him, and
headed off to the bright lights of Winemucca.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">That was when I learned the power of
speed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Another tv story.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I sued some people once. I don’t
remember what it was about actually but that’s not relevant. I got
a medium up on the stand. She could channel Alexander the Great. I
decided to use him as a character witness. It was at this point that
the judge chose to disallow press in the courtroom. I went out and
had my left eyeball replaced with a Hi-8 camera (professional
quality, full colour separation). The single point of view shots
actually made for better style. It gave it all a Woody Allen feel.
And it made me look sympathetic.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Of course Alexander was only willing
to speak in his own mother tongue (a Turkish offshoot of ancient
Greek). We advertised all over for a translator. We found one woman
out in Calgary that spoke it but it was all that she spoke, so that
was no good. In the end, I was forced to do the translating myself. I
mean, I did translate properly. I do have integrity.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So then, the next snag - Alexander
had never heard of me, was unwilling to provide a character
reference, and merely laughed at the threat of being held for
contempt. I took that all the way to the supreme court. I mean, I’d
been forced (under the threat of legal sanctions) to attend public
school and learn about Alexander, yet he didn’t know who I was.
What sort of a basis is that for a democracy?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The plea bargaining began. They
offered a position as starting center for the Montréal Canadiens. I
accepted, but only on the condition that I could play riding one of
those ice bikes, one of the ones with spikes instead of tires. They
counter-offered: Queen for a day. But they could only offer a day
when I would have had to spend the day watching soldiers march by a
reviewing stand. So I just took them all out. A hollow point each
from my Walther PPK (carved out of whale bone to get through
security).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Biggest ratings ever. Within 45
minutes there were 14 satellites with channels just rebroadcasting
the killing continuously.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">At first I worried about the police.
There was an advantage that Alexander knew me now, and would probably
give a good reference after the mayhem, but still it would be hard to
beat the rap on a simulcast crime. Luckily everyone had forgotten it
wasn’t fiction. The immediate families complained but they were
quickly locked up in the wards with people who thought they were
Thurston Howell III.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And I’d cleaned out the court room
when I left. I traded the stuff to Ted Turner for a 5% ownership in
the new Fox kids cartoon political panel show. The one where they let
real politicians fight it out using cartoon violence.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">That was when I learned the power of
caring.</P>

</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="happy-faces-western"></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And I like to think of myself as a
bit of an amateur scientist. Maybe I read a few too many Tom Swift
books as a child.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Heavy alpha radiation (plutonium’s
unpleasantness) is primarily a health risk because of the scattering
of heavy metals (impurities) throughout our bodies.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Unfortunately these carefully placed
impurities are essential to our continued good health. Intriguingly
this is a trait pecular to primates. It is only us monkeys who have
been discouraged by nature from playing with such toys. I was the one
who discovered this.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I have been breeding mongrels for
twenty years (a mix of terrier and shepherd). I was playing around
with purity of diet, purity and refinement, of both food and water.
And I must admit that it was merely by accident that I forgot to
include a source of heavy metals in their intake. Veterinary science
would have told me they would have died. But they didn’t. I have 94
healthy dogs completely heavy metal free. They are perfectly trained
to eat and drink only from carefully maintained feeding stations
throughout the city.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And I have implanted 1/16 of the
critical mass of plutonium into each of them.  A painless procedure
for them, done under local anesthesia. For me, the handling of such
amounts is sure to cause death within 5 to 10 years. Oh well.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So. If 16 or more of these dogs get
together, BOOM. Which randomly is pretty unlikely. From a quantum
mechanical point of view it is as likely as the appearance of three
foot mushrooms in everyone’s bathroom next election day.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Of course, if I blow my special
flocking whistle or am somehow unable to refill all the feeding
stations these probabilities increase.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I suggest it may be in your interest

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">One unlucky gust and the swarm of
grasshoppers (so thick that even a mile away you can't help but close

inward spiral that will leave them days later at the center of bare
dirt, with no food left but themselves.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">On any journey of a sizable length it
is vital to begin in the right direction.  So I want to figure out
exactly where to begin my story. It is made more difficult by the
fact that I don’t really have very much to say.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="happy-faces-western"></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Really I just want to have fun. I’m
a bit of a goof but I do mean well. Maybe I’m even a bit of a
romantic.  I mean a couple of years ago I woke up happy one morning,
a half pound lighter than usual, and asked my best friend to marry
me. She told me to fuck off, hung up the phone, threw her cat from
her chest, and was back to sleep within 17 seconds. When she awoke
two and a half hours later she had no memory of the phone call.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So I went through my address book,
not entirely randomly, phoning other single women friends, until
finally Brenda said ok, she'd marry me if I really wanted. We
arranged to meet at the food court at 12:30. She agreed to wear white
underwear once I conceded that the request was an unfortunate
reminder of my sexist traditional upbringing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We met and shared a poutine with
extra cheese (a wedding day being once in a lifetime), talked about
kids and breakfast foods and the contrast between flannel and
Egyptian cotton sheets and where we would live and how often we would
do laundry.  And we shared a medium diet coke, one cup, two straws.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But when the plastic seats began to
be uncomfortable I had to admit that I didn't know where city hall
was, and although she did she said that it would probably be closed
on a Saturday, and even if it had been a weekday she thought that
maybe being married at city hall was an anachronism (or even an
entirely untrue movie myth) and that their best bet would be to find
a judge, but she didn't know any.  I recalled I had known a judge in
Saskatoon, not that that helped, and anyway that judge had retired
and moved to Vancouver, and then I remembered that judge had married
my brother and sister-in-law, so Brenda was probably right.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So instead we just wandered around
the mall, giggling a lot and making up our own connect the dots game,
until the stores closed and I walked her home. We almost kissed at
her door and then I skipped off into the night.</P>

I was standing in a parking lot in Las Vegas, with the eight wonders
of the world surrounding me in neon. Everything antiseptic dirt and
dry heat. And then I see my niece Beth standing inside a wire fence,
beside a pool at the Motel 6. And I just walk over and go through a
convenient gate in the fence. And she notices me and runs over and
gives me a hug. And Peter is there, before his prison tattoos. And
then I notice I'm wearing no pants, but we're at a pool anyway, and
they both know I'm a goof so I don't care. And we just hang around,
eating home-made popsicles and doing cannonballs. And hours later a
big green UFO zooms in with a sound of electric horror and sucks me
up. And I awake to my alarm.</P>

little hugs every day.  But when he grew up a little, became a little
boy, loud and gregarious as boys always are, she realized he was
actually a separate person and her shyness returned.  After the age
of seven, the only physical contact she had with him was holding his
hand when they walked in town, and occasional kisses on the cheek
(one each birthday, christmas, and when departing or arriving from
any journey).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And Carl might have seemed gregarious
to his mother, but he had inherited her shyness. He never fought or
wrestled, he never joined the football team, he never went to the
school dances. He was embarrassed and confused at how alone he felt,
and how much he craved some sort of contact. And how easy it seemed
for everyone else.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Once, when he was twelve, and a new
guy moved into town, and before the new guy had 'learned about Carl',
the new guy played a practical joke (the old pail of water on top of
the door) and got Carl soaking wet.  And Carl loved it, it was so
palsy,  almost like a hug.  But of course, Carl didn't get mad like
he should have, and that just left all his classmates even more
intimidated by him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But Carl grew up, and in the end he
wasn't particularly unhappy.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So, from the age of seven, for the
rest of his life, Carl never touched another person, except for firm
handshakes, familial kisses, and not too tight hugs. He never cupped
a person's face in his hand. I mean, at least physically, at one
level.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But then you get into philosophy, and
the sex drive.  I mean, I have this one friend who has been forgiven
for the most insensitive, destructive acts by past lovers, because
they all feel he has some uncontrollably strong sex drive. He would
die without a regular fuck. Its just a scam they all play on
themselves, because he's cute, and I'm sure he's great in bed, but
that he'd die. Come on now. I mean, who hasn't sometimes felt like
that, but you just masturbate, more than once if you have to, and it
all becomes manageable again.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So Carl. Carl had a sex drive. That
he dealt with. And considering he couldn't even imagine kissing
someone, let alone sex, he saw no reason to be self conscious. He had
nothing to gain or lose.  I mean, he was shy, it was hard to talk to
anybody, but it was no easier to tell someone about what he had
ordered for breakfast, than to tell them about his late night virtual
world.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I have a portion of a letter he wrote
to his friend Wilfred Franklin:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;I can remember, as an
adolescent, when I would have dreams during my sleep, dreams of sex,
and these dreams would be so intensely physical. I would feel the
woman's skin, and feel all of her textures. I was amazed, I couldn't
imagine where those sensations were coming from. They were all so
real, they had to be based on memories, but memories beyond my
recollection, memories beyond my life. As I have grown older these
physical dreams have stopped. Now my dreams are purely visual. I see
the bodies and the acts and they are beautiful and sensual in and of
themselves.  I must admit to you, my dear friend, that I have not
been able to give up all hope of ever being with a woman, in this
lifetime, but I have certainly lost the ability to even fantasize
such an event. It seems easier to imagine that the world will end
tomorrow in one of those fiery cataclysms described by Wells.  So,
although it must have been a slow process, I have realized that now
the objects of my sexual desire are no longer women themselves, but
merely the images of women. I have had to bypass my skin.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So it wasn't that Carl made the first
pornographic movie. He never made any. It was a letter he wrote to
Wilfred Franklin that made Franklin make the first movie.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Before this, pornography excited men
because it was proof that somewhere their sadly ideal world existed,
where real women would walk around naked, and smile, and do exactly
what men wanted.  It was an aid to imagining real physicality's, real
touches.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But Franklin was a technical genius,
just beginning to understand this new media, of moving pictures, and
how much easier it made fooling the mind into an alternate reality.
And he was intrigued by Carl's new found mode of sex, and became
determined to find it himself, through his art.  And he did.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Carl never watched any of Franklin's
movies.  He was a bit too much of a prude.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Whenever a person is captured in the
act of committing a first degree felony they are brought to our
clinic. We brainwash the felon to make him or her believe that they
never actually committed the crime. They believe they did all the
planning and preparation but that they chickened out at the last
minute. We leave a memory of performing the crime and the arrest, but
as a stylized memory. They would generally describe it as a bad
daydream, part of the reason they chose not to go through with it.
Then we pump them full of depressants and drop them back on the
streets.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I think the most beautiful thing in
the world is the power of recursive situations. They are left with a
memory of having received our brainwashing treatment. And that part
we leave as a very tangible memory. But we have also planted urban
legends about this sort of treatment into the population, but with an
obvious bias of being an example of standard paranoid delusion
thinking. So the felons are left with a very disturbing memory of
having people wrench changes in their reality, a memory that makes
them question their own sanity, a memory they don’t feel
comfortable sharing with others. Something they must bottle up
inside.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We have a very low recidivism rate.
Part of our contract with these cities involves planting surveillance
equipment into everyone we process and monitoring their progress for
the next four months as a form of insurance. We receive an extra
$80,000 per felon to perform this surveillance. We are supposed to
place sub-dermal positional tracking devices and microphones. We have
built a control center in each city. But we don’t actually bother
doing any of the surveillance; it would really eat away at the profit
margin.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">It will begin with a young woman
happily strolling down a sunny street with a red bag labeled Home
Hardware. This red bag will be fairly flat, about a foot square. It
won’t be empty, but light enough that it isn’t any sort of burden
for the woman carrying it. She will have some sort of uniform on as
well, although this will be more obvious only when one sees a
different person in the same ‘uniform’.  This woman will come up
to a person lying on one of those sliding trays underneath his car.
It will be choreographed well enough that she doesn’t have to alter
her pace to pull an item out of her bag as she comes up to him, and
hand it into his hand as he half slides out and reaches up. You will
never see his face.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">She will meet up with a colleague
(same outfit and bag) at the next street corner and they will smile
at each other and go up to a front door. He (the colleague) will ring
the doorbell.  A young mother will answer the door, invite them in.
They will walk into the living room and attach their two magic bags
together so that they can pull out a fully assembled children’s
sized easel.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">They will walk out the door and split
up. The camera will follow the man. He will continue down the street.
He will pass one child and hand her one end of a skipping rope. It
will trail out of his bag as he walks. He will reach down and pass
the other end to another child as he passes her. He will stop, make a
small private grin, take two backward steps, jump over the skipping
rope (that the children haven’t begun to twirl yet) and continue
forward.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He will notice a woman who has
stepped out her front door and is gesturing to him. He will go to the
house and into the bathroom to find a faucet half disassembled. He
will reach into his bag and brings out a small washer.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The woman will take the washer, which
will fit perfectly, and will quickly finish re-assembling the faucet.
She will turn to the man and shake his hand. He will lean in and
whisper in her ear. She will laugh, nod and walk out of the bathroom,
leaving him in there, closing the door as she leaves.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I had an earlier version of this
where I said my life was a trip on one of Magic Bus Inc’s wild
rides on old school buses. Overland from London to Bombay in 7 to 10
weeks, depending on wars. And in Afghanistan the bus would drop down
into a valley, a valley with a six foot ground fog of death, the
final moist exhalations of thousands of dying children. And I would
ride on top of the bus above this fog. I would rescue a woman too,
and spend days just holding her, squeezing her. Squeezing the stench
of death out of her, scraping it off her skin and then bathing her
with my own sweat having run out of clean water.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And stop after stop after stop. It
seems like you are always standing still. Except sometimes the bus
will make a big jump ahead. Six or eight hours on the road. And then
when it finally does stop you have forgotten what that feels like.
And you get off the bus and almost fall because the world isn’t
rushing by. You spend the 10 minute break just leaning against a wall
and people mistake it for being cool.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And the bus windows. The bus windows
are my existentialism (to be removed in case of emergency). The
toilet at the back that nobody uses, but keeps your bladder from
bursting just because it is there. That is my United Church
upbringing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

day and spent about half an hour slowly and carefully building up a

certain amount of momentum, enough momentum to smash the brick apart,

tank of gas, and over inflated tires for extra traction, and the air
conditioning off (for extra torque). And everyone terrified except
for me, even my brother scared, driving. And at the top of the road
was a parking lot, and a rocky path, and we left the car wheezing

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Maybe the thing I’m most proud of
in my life is having single-handedly caused the resurgence of
popularity in the old Dick Van Dyke show in the metropolitan area of
Toronto. An old friend of mine has ridden this wave to big time
success. His most recent theme party had more than 3,000 attendees
dressed up as Danny Thomas alone. People ask me if I’m jealous. My
part in the process is pretty unsung. But Tom always lets me into the
parties for free, and more importantly into the cool sub, pre and
post events. And I must admit at the risk of appearing masculine that
anything that makes women try and be  like Mary Tyler Moore is a good
thing.</P>

did ride my bike every day to work. And sometimes I would dress
inappropriately for the temperature in the morning because I knew it
would be warmer by the afternoon and on those days I would have to
ride extra hard to stay warm. And I did follow the route described
above.  And I did go through the red light at the bottom of the hill
every time.  And if I was pedaling really hard and kept up my speed
on the straight-away after the hill then I could make it through the
yellow light of the left turn signal at the next intersection. A wide
two lane turn that I would still have to take with my knee almost
scraping dust because of my speed. And one day my tire did explode
just as I was about to start that turn. And I did just lock the back
brakes and pump the front brakes and come to an entirely controlled
stop as the light turned red.  I was pretty impressed with myself at
not cracking my skull but I certainly was too occupied to notice
something in the ditch. Luckily this intersection was almost at my
office so I just dismounted and carried my bike the last block and a
half.</P>

have had additional limbs attached. It’s not that I feel a need for
extra limbs. I mean sometimes when I’m fixing my bicycle I will
pick up tools with my feet if it would be awkward to bend down. And I
must admit I wouldn’t mind having slightly more useful feet. I
don’t think I would care about the full functionality of an
opposable toe but slightly longer toes certainly wouldn’t hurt. I’m
not comfortable calling this a need though.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But if I were called Johnny Steam I
would have extra limbs attached just for the experience (and to try
to build up a false sense of family connectedness). As each aunt or
cousin died I would have one of their fingers added to my feet. I
would probably remove a toe at the same time (replace the toe with a
finger) so that I could still wear store bought shoes.</P>

They’re nice people but I don’t want to live with any of them 24

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The spring of the year that I was in
grade three I decided the world was just like books.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I read lots of  books about space
ships and outer space and stuff like that. And I found a patch of
dandelions out on the school playground. I mean, the school
playground was all dandelions, but, I identified a small section of
this that accurately and completely encoded a description of our
solar system. It wasn’t a simple map. I was a math wizard sort of
kid. It encoded (through the position of the clumps, and the number
of flowers in each clump) for each of the nine planets its position
from the sun and its number of moons.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Now, as in other things I have
mentioned from my childhood, a short description of an aspect of the
North American prairies might be useful. Green lawn sort of grass
doesn’t grow naturally there. It requires extensive watering.
People do that sort of thing for their own yards, and it is even done
for some special public parks, but something like a school playground
is left more natural for ease of maintenance. Natural prairie grasses
grow together in little bunches from 2 to 8 inches across<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.
In between these bunches is just bare dirt, which erodes a little. So
these bunches are tiny hills too.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So, when I talk about clumps of
dandelions it doesn’t involve the sort of arbitrary grouping one
could do on a continuous lawn. A clump was a non-negotiable thing. Of
course, the grouping of clumps into bunches remained open to
interpretation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I mean, in the end I don’t in any
sense believe that god was giving me a sign. I didn’t think he was
back then either. And I also don’t think I would be able to see
that encoding now if I saw the same dandelions. Of course, I wouldn’t
get the same thing out of a grade 3 level book on the solar system
either.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Later that same summer I spent three
days collecting long grass from the various ditches near my house. I
would only collect yellow grass more than a foot tall. And I would
collect it into bundles and tie them up like sheaves. I even talked a
friend (well, not really a friend; I didn’t like him) to help me.
We had collected quite a few sheaves (for eight year olds) before my
mom made us stop. I couldn’t explain why I was doing it, but then I
didn’t know why farmers did it either.</P>

a game of chess. It was easy enough to find a partner for that.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The first letter arrived scented with
sweet peas, Russian thistle and ivory soap. The envelope parchment. A
stamp featuring an old cathedral.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He had written it with his left hand.
It was a faintly familiar childish handwriting. It was from
Evangeline, a woman of his imagination.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Like wearing clean underwear in case
of an accident, he had picked an entirely fictitious name. He knew
some of his female friends worried that he might be obsessed with
them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This first letter was set in Spain,
Valencia. She described her days wandering the countryside. It’s a
great place to hike, no bugs, almost a deafening heat, but an oasis
of orange trees every couple of miles. And you can steal all the
oranges you want. None of the farmers have the energy to bother
chasing you. After a couple of days of a solely orange diet (food and
drink) the diarrhea is pretty intense, but as long as you're by
yourself its ok.  And it only lasts a couple of days.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The second letter was stained with
red wine. She had finally run into a young rancher willing to chase
her for his oranges. They were living together in a white plaster
building, clay tile roof, no glass in the windows. The rancher's tame
bull would stand at the window and look in as they played at sex on
his duck feather mattress.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The third letter Johnny wrote late at
night, drunk from an evening spent in a strip bar. She was bored of
the rancher. And the rancher was only in love with the sex. She
talked of when she had first heard of Johnny, word of mouth from an
ex-roommate.  And why she had started to write to him, but that part
was hard to understand, almost religious. She seemed to be thinking
it was one of those spiritual connection things that are sometimes
used to try and mask simple lust.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The fourth letter, she was back on
the road again, and back to the cities.  And out of Spain. She had
caught a ride with a Pepsi machine repair man on his way to a crisis
in northern Greece. 800 miles in 19 hours with $4000 of speeding
tickets and 5.4 grams of cocaine. Two days after they had arrived she
was still pacing the sea wall in Thesaloniki, her nose still
bleeding.  She was staying at the youth hostel, making room and board
by low-tech forgery.  Her goal in life was to acquire a taste for
cheap Greek pine flavored wine.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Her fifth letter, Johnny had to
question its truthfulness. She claimed to have walked all the way to
Athens. Her description of the city was very superficial, as if she'd
only ever seen brochures, or maybe a low-altitude fly-over. She said
he could send her a reply care of the American Express there. It was
the first time she'd mentioned a two-way communication. Johnny didn't
bother sending a reply.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Her sixth arrived postmarked
Istanbul. Johnny threw it away unopened.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The seventh came from Prague. She was
high on intellectualism. Minds were boiling over in the vacuum of
freedom. Art was life. Anarchy was her religion. The letter went on
for 15 pages. And the paper, exquisite, hand made, scraps of bus
transfers barely visible. She was living on baguettes, chocolate and
weak tea.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The eight and ninth letters came from
Prague as well. She was living the examined life. She appeared much
more calm and cool. She was happier than she'd ever been.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But the air in Prague was yellow and
her lungs had begun to ache.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The tenth letter was short. It just
said when her plane would arrive. Johnny had even phoned a travel
agent for information so he could use real flight times.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He went out to the airport when the
day came, even though he knew she wouldn't be on the plane.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Johnny had always wanted to live on
one of those Caribbean islands with great don’t-give-a-damn
accents. Probably for all the wrong reasons but he couldn’t be
bothered asking for particular forgiveness for this.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He would open a beach-front
restaurant with shutters and no glass. And drinks with four ounces
per, so toxic he would have to buy his little umbrellas with glass
stems so they wouldn’t dissolve.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And whenever there was a break, the
restaurant completely empty, he would pour himself a glass of tea
take his notebook and sit at a table by the window.  And when a
customer came in he would let them seat themselves, and let them just
relax for a few minutes until they were just about to leave. Then he
would get up and walk over and laugh with them, say the owner had run
out a few minutes ago just to say a quick hello to a lover,
“obviously there has been some sort of delay” but Johnny knows
where everything is pretty much and he’s sure the owner would be
happy if they all just made themselves at home.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And sometimes they would be too upset
at the delay and leave anyways, but Johnny didn’t need customers
like that. Usually they would stay. Johnny can be quite disarming.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And a few hours later these first
customers would be helping more recent arrivals. And someone would be
trying to get people to have a milkshake or a frothy rum punch or
something like that because he wants another chance to use the mixer
(which is just like the one at the soda counter in Woolworth’s when
he used to go with his dad, that he never got to use, back then).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And when someone decided they finally
did have to leave, Johnny would dig up an old creased menu that
actually didn’t have any of the specific things the customers had
made. And he would leave it up to them to choose an amount. Except if
they decided to leave way too much, then Johnny would make them take
some back.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He would get a bunch of repeat
business but the tourists would never stay on the island for more
than two weeks, so few would figure out the deception. And those that
did would usually just be tremendously amused. One time a famous
writer from Oregon would come down and figure it all out and come in
and make a big scene, very irate. After she would leave Johnny would
explain that this was a local custom, a gesture of respect. The
patrons would be excited to have such a story to take home with them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And he would call the restaurant Sun,
not ‘The Sun’ and not Son with an o. He would claim it was called
that when he bought it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And it would be on the west side of
the island to get the sunset. And the island would be two miles
across, from east to west, at that point. So he would see the sun
rise over the water every morning as well, but not without some
effort.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And he would tell all his neighbors
that his notebooks were filled with them, that he was writing down
their story. But he would never let them see, claiming there was no
need, that they knew all he was learning, all that he was writing,
already.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">They wouldn’t have even been
interested in his scribblings if he hadn’t withheld them, made them
secret. This mystery would create a small vacuum, small but
persistent. And this vacuum would draw out a mythology from them.
They would create the stories supposedly stolen from his notebooks.
Some supposedly read by candlelight as he slept drunkenly unaware in
the next room. Some overheard as pillow talk between himself and the
moon. Some constructed from snippets heard repeated by parrots. Some
written in the tea leaves at the bottom of his cups.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">They would laugh at him good
naturedly because of his fanciful nature, his imagination, the flaws
and invisible truths in the stories they claimed he had written.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And on the first day of spring they
would bring him a new notebook and a pen, always of some bright
colour. And for some reason no one could recall, these things would
be brought by all the children of the island as a group, although
they wouldn’t dress up for it. He would offer them all a glass of
champagne, and they would accept. He would serve them 7-Up. They
would sit quietly for half an hour (an eternity) and then run off and
play solidly until twilight.</P>

My favorite weapon is the shotgun. Others prefer the chaingun or the

it the screen shudders with the recoil. And the bad guys are thrown
backwards as they die. And then the perfect sound of the barrels
breaking open, KACHUNK. You can feel the fluid motion in your

We sold the titanium lid immediately and spent two years living

had already cut off our allowance. We sold the tube during the

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">There is a spot in Ohio. Johnny
Appleseed had passed by the spot in 1740 as he took a detour towards
some smoke in the distance. He had run out of tea a number of weeks
earlier and although he learned many recipes from the Indians of the
Ohio valley for making medicinal and recreational teas from
indigenous plants they had all tasted bitter to him, like spicy dirt.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He hoped that whoever was at the
smoke would have some English or Indian tea. And although Johnny
didn’t have any money he had been successful in the past at trading
on his fame, showing people his clippings from the New Jersey
newspapers and retelling his stories until his hosts would give him
whatever he wanted, and he would go on his way.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So this was what was on his mind as
he sat by the creek to take a short rest. He found that the dynamics
of these visits always went better when he arrived well rested.  But
the ground he was sitting on was very unruly, full of thistles and
wild flowers and other useless plants. And he couldn’t resist his
urge to spend an hour and pull them all out, burn them, and plant one
of his precious apple seeds.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And it was the third generation child
of this tree in 1910, a total of 47 feet from where Johnny had
planted the seed, under which Frank Strom sat on an equally hot day
thinking about the school dance that evening. Thinking and lazing,
and eating the big juicy apples that hung down so low on the branches
he didn’t even have to stand up to pick them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Unfortunately, these apples were
still green. And it was that evening just after Frank had built up
the courage to ask Janet to dance and she had said yes, that he
realized the intestinal degree of his gastronomic mistake that
afternoon. He tried to soldier through it. He began the dance. But he
had to run away before it was done. And he didn’t have the guts to
tell Janet why.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And it was a horrible night, best not
discussed in detail. He fell asleep lying in the bushes, comforted by
the cool chill of the damp ground, too exhausted to make it home.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When he awoke the sun had been up for
more than an hour and he, the ground and the bushes were all dry. He
stretched and all his joints cracked, even his back, a series of pops
like tearing off the strip on the top of a new box of cereal. His
stomach was calm. He was hungry, and happy. He smiled, at no one in
particular.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And then he remembered the night
before, and Janet, and wondered if she, or anyone else, had heard him
groaning and grunting in the bushes. And he realized he couldn’t
face anyone in his home town every again.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He headed off in the same direction
as Johnny Appleseed had 170 years before, northwest. He had a
different destination though. Frank was heading for the fabled
mountains of Saskatchewan.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And James Spyker was  born in 1963, a
third generation child of Frank Strom on the farm he had homesteaded
fifty years before. The farm was on the Caderre river. The river
flowed through the farm with banks 45 feet deep, and fairly steep.
This was the closest thing to a mountain that Frank had been able to
find in Saskatchewan.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Unfortunately for our story, nothing
worth mentioning ever happened to James Spyker during his lifetime.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Now, if we weren’t saddled by the

tales. It could keep you amused and intrigued for days if it wanted
to. But one musn’t digress.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;One for the pot and two for the
cook&quot; was his motto when he cooked with wine. He'd call it Beef
Bourgione because the wine was red, but it was really just a stew,
and he didn't bother with a recipe when he cooked a stew.  That had
been one of the things that had always bothered Joan. Even when he
was using a recipe he would measure with the regular spoons and use
the small glasses that looked as if they must hold about a cup. She
would glare at him when he brought in a loaf cake only an inch and a
half high, and only manage to hide her anger when everything turned
out perfectly.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But he didn't mind. If she wanted to
spend her time being mad, who was he to judge?
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He missed her anger, even after only
two days. The suddenness of her departure had left him unprepared.
The small weekday dinner party they had planned a couple of weeks ago
had become a homecoming celebration. He had left work at noon to
begin preparations. She would be getting back just in time to eat.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The vegetables were finished giving
up their water so the broth was thin and almost reached the top of
the pot. It was at a perfect simmer, slowly sputtering away, covering
the stove with a red rash. The wine had made him hungry already, but
the heavy aroma of the stew was enough to appease it. Uncleanness was
another thing that had always bothered Joan, but not untidiness. She
left piles of papers around the house like bread crumbs, but all the
piles got dusted once a week.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He put the lid on the pot, knocked
back another glass of wine and got out the vacuum cleaner. He did a
thorough job, as was his habit, moving all the chairs and tables to
get underneath and around. The stem vase with its flowers (dried,
from their garden last year) had been pushed too near the edge of the
table, to make way for a stack of magazines. It might have survived
the fall to the carpeting, but he made a stumbling move to try and
catch it that sent it smashing into the wall. &quot;Damn!&quot; He
took up the vacuum again and flipped the beater bar upside down. He
brought it crashing down on the remains of glass and flowers on the
carpet. A few more whacks and it was all in small bits.  He flipped
the beater bar back upright and sucked up all the shards and petals.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Cleaning done, he was back to the
stew. It was thicker now. The bubbles were bigger and slower. It
looked almost alive, like a witch's brew. He stirred it around,
searching for the bay leaf. She was always embarrassed if it made it
to the table. &quot;What is or guest supposed to do? Leave it at the
edge of his plate like a bone from some fast food chicken?&quot; But
she demanded no more of him than she did of herself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The stew was ready to rest now. He
shut off the burner. The guests would be arriving shortly. He laid
the table, put some Charlie Parker on the stereo and opened another
bottle of wine to breathe.  He turned the oven to high and got the
pan of biscuits from the fridge. When he opened the oven door he
noticed the absence of the waft of heat. The pilot light was out.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He went back to the kitchen table and
poured himself another glass of wine. He sat down to wait.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The smell was awful, and he had a
headache in a couple of minutes.  He laid his forehead against the
cool top of the kitchen table. But the cool seemed to make his head
throb. He drained his glass, filled it, and drained it again. He
immediately realized that that had been a mistake.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The nausea started in the back of his
throat. He could feel it slide down into his stomach. He fell to his
knees and vomited all that he contained.  It was primarily a pool of
wine.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He stumbled to the patio door of the
kitchen and managed to open it and get out into the back yard. He
fell down into the grass.  It was a warm spring day, with a pleasant
breeze, and he was feeling much better in only a couple of minutes.
The excitement had even sobered him up.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He first dashed into the kitchen to
turn off the stove, with his undershirt pulled up to cover his mouth.
He waited outside again for about five minutes, and then went back in
the house to open all the other windows up.  He couldn't smell the
gas at all anymore, but he knew that his sense of smell might be a
bit out of whack.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He waited another ten minutes, but by
then it was getting close to when his guests might start to arrive.
While still outside he lit a match and held it far out in front of
him as he approached the kitchen door.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He managed to get inside with no
explosion.  He lit the pilot light on the stove and got the biscuits

person in order to brake to a stop. People would find this very
disturbing, but would feel uncomfortable directly objecting to it.
These hovercraft would serve the same purpose as an entourage in
providing you with an appropriate buffer from the thronging masses,
without blocking your view. They could also be used to store cold
beverages. I expect with current technology you would have to remain
somewhat aware of where you were walking, staying away from the very
edges of sidewalks to avoid losing these hovercraft in traffic, but
that shouldn’t be a problem for someone with your skills. You seem
very cognizant of your surroundings.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Tom Schneider: For you I would create
another system based on cellular phones, as I would guess you are
someone who tools around the city a fair bit. The cell phone would
transmit your location to a base unit though. The bulk of the device
wouldn’t travel with you. It does seem to me that you like to
travel light. I could make the device you had to carry no larger than
a cigarette case.  All the base unit would do is make unobtrusive
calls (with a soft generated voice) to anyone of your friends who
happened to be sitting near you (with their cellular phones) to let
them know of your presence. There would specifically be no way of
your determining who it was that had received these calls, so the
friend would still be able to comfortably not look for you if they
were otherwise engaged or not in the mood. This piece of technology
would probably be priced high as it would involve the illegal act of
breaking into the logging system of the cellular distributors in your
area. Other than that act, it is of course just a simple matter of
comparing numbers against your personal list of friend’s cell phone
numbers. The system would only notify people that made or received
two or more calls from the cell you are currently in (so as not to
disturb people just driving by).</P>

particularily modern or elegant. Simply a low power transmitter that
would work at about the same 60 Hertz as the North American power
grid. The frequency would be off just enough to create a beating
effect in the overlapping waves. Almost every device in the world
would be entirely unaffected by this beating. The single exception
being the flourescent light bulb. Flourescent bulbs would dim by
about 75% within a ten foot radius of you and the transmitter.  This
would also be available in a 50 Hertz model for use in Europe.</P>

just because I did wake up. The amount of time it’s taking to get
back to sleep has gotten shorter in the last few years. This night
fear probably only lasts five minutes these days. Let me try and tell

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I don’t know a lot about my
ancestors. I mean I’m sure they had bad teeth, open sores and
strong thighs like most folk a few hundred years ago. There is one
‘tale’, an oral tradition, of some gypsies in my past. Gypsies
living in Sherwood Forest, in England, around the time of the
mythical Robin Hood.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">That forest was a pretty lively place
back then. One of the few places you could still live off of hunting
in Britain. So it was the home of all the anarchists.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">My ancestors, their thing was
patience. Their major tool was waiting. And self control. They taught
their kids hard. As soon as they could speak they were allowed to ask
for anything they wanted. And as long as it was reasonable they would
get it. But part of the asking was that after making the request they
had to sit still for two hours. Sit motionless and quiet.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And their coming of age thing. The
elders would build a fire in a big pit, let it burn down, cover the
ashes with a thin layer of dirt, so that the dirt would warm up to
body temperature. And the young man or woman would lie down on this
ground. And warm wax would be poured on top of them, covering them
entirely. The last thing to be covered was their nostrils, their
nose. And their last intake of breath would be scented with flowers
and honey. And then their nose would be sealed as well. And the
elders would hold the novice down as he or she thrashed about, but
through the thick layer of wax the novice couldn’t feel individual
hands, just a sense of the futility of motion. And once the novice
had passed out he or she was left one minute longer. Then the warm
wax was removed from their nostrils and mouth, and they would begin
to breath.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And they would be awakened in the
most gentle way. With warmth and tender caresses. And they would be
told a lie, that they had been encased in the wax for hours.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And then they were an adult.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And whenever a person died in their
tribe the elders would encase the body in the same way, in wax, and
leave it up in a tree. And the tribe would move on immediately,
before even hours had passed. That was why they were gypsies.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But, now that I’ve gone to the
trouble of telling you that, it occurs to me that it isn’t actually
relevant to the issue at hand, me .. and my night fears. I mean, I
can come up with all sorts of weird ways to look at death.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Like, I’ve always wanted to write
an episode for one of the Star Trek series, doesn’t matter which
one. Where the pivotal fact is that they realize that each time they
use the transporter, the original instance of themselves dies an
agonizing death as the body is blasted apart by the transporter beam,
but the new instance is created without that memory, its like
shredding the original of a document after you have faxed it to
someone.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">One of the various godlike species
would point this out to them, this agonizing death, and judge them.
And the result would be that they would agree that in this case
ignorance was valid. And there would just be a small mechanical
change to the transporter system, to stun the person just before they
are blasted apart, so that they don’t feel the pain.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And then everything would be back to
normal.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Or, a slight plot alternative, at the
judging the Federation defense could be that everyone actually
already knows about the agonizing death thing. It’s just one of the
accepted things that no one talks about, like toilets. This
‘abandonment of an instance’ that happens in the transporter is
considered equivalent to changing your mind.  O.K. this isn’t as
easy to explain. Probably a bit too philosophical for prime time. Let
me give you an analogy, an example from my own life.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I went to meet a friend for lunch a
couple of weeks ago. I hadn’t seen her for about four years. And we
met and hugged and ordered some soup, and began to chat. And, as you
will recall, it was pretty close to election time back then, so
eventually we weren’t able to keep away from politics. And back in
university, when we met, we have been pretty similar. But now, she
has a family, and a mortgage, and really felt morally justified in
getting that 30% extra. I couldn’t believe it. She wasn’t the
same person at all. I mean, we finished things up politely, and I did
let her pay (I never believe in restaurant bill politics). But on my
way home I stopped at the police station. And filed a missing
person’s report. Explained the situation, that this ‘new’ Diane
was obviously responsible for the non-existence of the ‘old’
Diane I used to know. I was hoping that they would at least arrest
her on manslaughter charges, but it appears that they aren’t going
to do anything at all. It seemed disturbing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But I did think, well, if they aren’t
going to bother with tracking down murders at the moment, because of
staffing issues or whatever, well, if that was the case, it seemed
the perfect time to do something I’ve been meaning to for awhile.
So I found this landlord I had had a few years ago. A real slumlord,
I could tell you stories, but.    Anyways, I did it humanely. There
was no pain, the body just collapsed to the floor. And he had no
family, no private life. His relationship with the world was entirely
and solely related to his business. And the business, as soon as the
body was discovered, passed into the hands of a property manager, who
is doing everything wonderfully. So, really, the landlord hasn’t
died at all. There is just this currently unused body lying around,
and the landlord has become a nicer person.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Actually, I might explain it a little
differently, but the above is the wording suggested by my lawyer.
The police are being pretty damn arbitrary. They haven’t charged
‘new’ Diane, but they have charged me.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">So, back to the Star Trek thing. The
federation’s defense would be that the transporter thing is like
the first case ‘old’ Diane - ‘new’ Diane rather than the
second case ‘old’ landlord - ‘new’ landlord.   In some ways
its even less horrid than the old-new Diane thing.  I expect that
‘old’ Diane dies an agonizing death every time ‘new’ Diane
buys another Globe and Mail. At least the transporter thing happens
only once per instance.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Another example:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">By the time Jorge was twenty two he
was already considered one of the finest minds in Buenos Aires, and
was a sought after guest for cocktail parties and light supper
evenings.  He enjoyed these events, especially the rich food and
beautifully scented women, and he was easily distracted by the
conversations,  delicate constructions of fancies and theories.  His
true passion though was for immortality.  He was unwilling to believe
that his existence was merely temporary.  As a child he had been
thrilled with puzzles of wood and string and metal hoops, removing
the hoop from the string without untying any of the knots.  He liked
to convince his friends that each puzzle was impossible, being
formal, starting with facts and corollaries and building a solid
theorem.  Once he had them completely convinced, he would make the
one simple gesture that removed the hoop.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He didn't bother dealing with the
physical, with the body and aging and decay.  A very busy road is
almost never the right path.  He studied Buddhism for awhile, but
eventually realized that its notion of heaven was actually even more
abhorrent to him than death.  He was watching an electrician work one
day though, turning lights on and off, flipping switches, figuring
out first what worked and then building from there. He was watching
this electrician work when he had his inspiration, and like his
tricks with the metal hoops, it seemed largely stupid to his friends.
 Jorge took this to be a good sign.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He spent a preliminary year figuring
out exactly how much of himself could become immortal.  He had become
a well respected writer accidentally along the way, which made an
obvious starting point.  In the end it seemed mostly to be about his
way of writing and of thinking, but it wasn't easy to specify.
Luckily that wasn't necessary.  He needed as much time as possible
for the second stage.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For the second stage he merely had to
simplify the view of himself, until he was totally contained within
the immortal bits.  The last few years of his life he claimed to have
achieved his goals, but of course nobody knows.  And, of course, he
still died.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Johnny was in a Dunkin' Donuts
sipping a hot chocolate one Tuesday morning when he noticed that the
person beside him was Jorge Louis Borges, sitting with a coffee and a
glazed cruller.  Borges said he found the combination of caffeine and
honey kept his memories moist and pliable.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He didn't look much like the picture
from the dust jacket.  He looked much younger.  And he was black, and
a woman. Actually, it would be more true to say that the young black
woman was Borges, but in the same sense that she was thin or she was
cold, not that she was possessed by some soul sucking psychic
vampire. Johnny mentioned this to her.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">She laughed at these observations,
and began one of her little stories. &quot;There was a young man who
lived in Buenos Aires in the 1890's. He had  a great many lovers,
both male and female. He refused to distinguish between any of them.
He called them all Alexa. He never made dates, but each night he
would go to one of their apartments, or he would go to a bar and
search for another Alexa. None of them were pleased by his behavior,
but when their turn came, he was such a good lover, intense as if no
one else existed, that they forgave him. Or if one of them couldn't
forgive him and barred her door against him, he would hardly notice,
there was always another Alexa only a few blocks away.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This did not incite an obvious reply.
After a short pause Johnny said &quot;I've always been fond of
natural disasters, tornadoes especially. They would never come as far
north as Saskatoon though, like crickets, but Regina got lots. I was
at an aunt's house once and I remember seeing the funnel in the
distance, dark black like a thunder cloud, which seemed funny, it was
darker than the dirt on the ground. We stood outside and watched it
because my uncle didn't trust the carpentry in his house.   It didn't
make any noise. We sat on squeaky metal chairs, ate orange popsicles,
and watched the tornado go by.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">She asked &quot; How many people were
hurt?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;I don't remember. A few I
guess. Actually, I don't think it ever happened.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Borges smiled again. She ate two
bites of her cruller, licked her fingers, and said &quot;I'm tired.
Let me ask you a few questions. For example, what is the essential
difference between dreams and reality?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;I don't know.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;Do you believe airline tickets
should be transferable?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;Yes, but not in the usual
sense.&quot;</P>

contemplated suicide?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Johnny thought for several seconds
before replying &quot;Well, I mean it’s been awhile since its been
an active goal, but you know, whenever I'm on a balcony or bridge it
does occur to me that the self control keeping me from jumping over
the edge is a pretty ephemeral thing.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;Do you remember your birth?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Johnny laughed . &quot;No, my mom
remembers that for me.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">She smiled again, leaned back in her
chair with a last fragment of her cruller, and said &quot;Why don't
you continue the story for me then.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;O.K. &quot; He paused. &quot;The
young man never thought of Alexa during the day. He was a student. He
filled his days reading books and scrolls in Greek and Sanskrit. He
discovered many things and wrote elaborate papers, but he wrote them
all in a language of his own invention, to ensure they would be read
only in the proper context. There was no such thing as 'and then one
day' in his life.  Everything continued regularly until he died at
the age of 62, of a heart attack, in the middle of the night.  It was
August, the temperature was 35 degrees Celsius, the body didn't grow
cold. Alexa didn't notice he was dead until the next morning. They
didn't have a public funeral. I found his papers in a tin box at the
library, many years after his death. They intrigued me.  It is a
beautiful looking script. I even found some Alexa's still alive, now
old men and women. They were willing to sleep with me, but it didn't
help me to decipher the text. I still don't understand any of the
symbols, but I'm translating it anyway. I've got to eat.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The young black woman, who no longer
looked anything like Borges, nodded in approval, and took her leave.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I like to enter a cocktail party
through a side door near the back of the room, at breakneck speed, as
if I had a four foot length of 2x4 held in both hands. And listen to
the sound in my brain as my imaginary 2x4 goes thwack, thwack, thwack
across the foreheads of any partygoers leaning against the wall. And
I let this imaginary violence slow me down, to a respectable striding
speed. And then I scan the crowd, checking for anybody I know. I give
myself five seconds. And then calculate my limit.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">I award myself an extra drink per
hour for every four acquaintances I spot in those five seconds (close
friends count as three acquaintances). My allowance is 3 plus the
acquaintance bonus.  (e.g. If I see 7 acquaintances in my five second
scan then my limit is 3 + (7/4) = 5 drinks per hour). So then, off to
the bar to drink half my hour’s allowance right away.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Now, when I’ve described all this
before there has been some confusion. To make things clear. I’m not
comfortable at cocktail parties. I’m not about to get drunk at
these things. I always drink some non-alcoholic cold beverage,
whatever they have with the highest caffeine content. And if I’m
not thirsty, or am already abuzz with caffeine from some chocolate
binge or something, I just get really small glasses.</P>

house. And you check to make sure the lights are all off, and you
have everything you need. You've got the stuff you're dropping off.
And the bank book because the credit card is due. And you've got the
list. The list is important. And a head full of times. The Saturday
brunch ends at 1:30. There's a movie at 4:15 if you can make it. But
better have the wine by then because the store'll be closed after.
Which is why you have the knapsack. To lug it all around. And you
think of her, but there's nothing you can do. But it distracts you
for a second and the cat gets out. So alter the schedule cause you
gotta come home between the movie and the dinner party because he'll
probably be cold and willing to come back in by then. Which maybe
means the movie's off. Which maybe means you should phone them,
arrange something, get that over with.</P>

	You start by rewiring the muscle groups in the lower back so that
	connected muscles that are always used together actually use a
	single nerve pathway. This multiplexing leaves some pathways free,
	and these are used to connect to the new limb. And connecting the
	veins and arteries and the lymphatic system is just straightforward
	plumbing.  They recommend adding an extra heart for each additional
	three limbs.   It takes a period of physical therapy to learn
	muscular control of the new arm. It is the same therapy as necessary
	in the case of debilitating strokes. Some people who have had
	special difficulties have had pacemaker like regulators added.
	Which these regulators a single neural command can cause a complex
	muscle interaction like the grasping motion of a hand.</P>

	I expect the evolutionary reason for this is that the mini gullies
	will make more water pool and absorb into the soil during the
	infrequent but heavy prairie rains. I’m sure the network of roots
	from these clumps actually infiltrates all of the soil, even below
	the bare patches.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="sdfootnote-western">And, speaking of
	evolution, I was so thrilled with myself a few years ago when I
	figured out the reason for cheese. Its a way of making milk stay
	edible longer in the absence of refrigeration. It’s an obvious
	food product. You’ve got milk lying around in some container. You
	know if you do nothing it will become horrible before you finish it.
	So you try all sorts of things to make it last longer. And soon
	enough you have cheese. It’s much more inevitable than figuring
	out how to make bread or a soufflé or something.</P>

	<p>Back in 1993 an agent, having heard me do an uninvited reading at a magazine launch, said that if I had a book she and I might be able
		to make some money out of it.  So I jammed a bunch of things together into <a href="/stories/denaturedboy.html">something</a> about the
	right length and sent it to her.  She was quite kind in her reply but did suggest that I maybe didn't actually know what a book was.</p>
